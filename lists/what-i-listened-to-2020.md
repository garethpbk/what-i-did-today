# WHAT DID YOU LISTEN TO TODAY?

## Keeping track of what I've been listening to, maybe some comments

### February 11, 2020

#### Devil Doll - Mr. Doctor

I don't know how to write about Devil Doll, other than to say that this is one of their more underrated releases and that they are one of the best groups of all time.

### February 10, 2020

#### Steven Wilson - To The Bone

I keep coming back to this album, it's very good! The first track is my favorite - such a good groove - but there's lots to like here. There are some meh songs - "Pariah" is kinda garbage lol - but overall it proves that Wilson's still got it. The latter half of 'Denotation' really sounds like old 90s-era Porcupine Tree, super rad.

#### Weakling - Dead As Dreams

It's Monday which means it's a great day to listen to Weakling. One of the best albums ever recorded, in any genre. No matter how many times I listen to this I will never tire of it.

#### Grst - Plague Seed

Found out about these guys because they released an EP of Weakling covers, woah! Their LP is pretty good, the inspiration is clear - not the most original music but very competently executed.

#### Inter Arma - Sulfur English

Finally got around to listening to this all the way through. It's good and real dark and spooky and heavy.

### February 7, 2020

#### Obsidian Tongue - Volume III

There's definitely a certain sound that many of the USBM acts currently making music share, and these guys definitely have it. But within it they do their own thing, the mix of harsh and clean vocals is done real well. This album doesn't feel as out there as their first but it's definitely more polished and coherent.

#### Elvenking - The Pagan Manifesto

This is definitely like their most ambitious and progressive album. It's still got plenty of poppy energy ('Twilight of Magic,' 'Moonbeam Stone Circle') but also a 13 minute opening song. I like Elvenking mostly for their catchiness and fun - I mean, it's ridiculous power metal, right - so it's not gonna be my fave from them, but it's really well executed.

#### Nightwish - Once

Well, I listened to most of it. Haven't in like almost 15 years. I dunno, it's a fun album with some hits but I'm overall very meh on the Nightwish sound.

#### Lurker of Chalice - Lurker of Chalice

The best thing Wrest ever did, no doubt. I have never heard anything that sounds like this and it's been 15 years since it came out. I don't have a favorite track, it's all astounding. The sample of Gwyneth Paltrow (I think?) as Sylvia Plath is funny tho.

---

### February 6, 2020

#### Oathbreaker - Rheia

This album does the dynamic loud/quiet thing so well, it's like the apex of a black metal + hardcore hybrid.

#### Blind Guardian - Nightfall in Middle Earth

Is this the best power metal album of all time? Yes, yes it is, and I don't just say that because I'm a huge Rings nerd.

#### Elvenking - Reader of the Runes - Divination

Pretty good!! Nothing much from Elvenking clicked with me other than The Winter Wake, which I love. Was originally gonna listen to that today but decided "hey let's try their newest album instead" and I don't regret it. I will return to this album, and probably more of their discography now.

---

### February 5, 2020

#### Spotify Dark & Gothic Radio

In the mood for this today. Lots o' great stuff here - Christian Death, Love and Rockets, Siouxsie and the Banshees...

---

### February 4, 2020

#### Sculptured - Apollo Ends

A more mature album than their first. Don't love the 10 minute noisey song or some of the horns but oh well. The core Sculptured sound is sooo good.

#### Sculptured - Embodiment

Give me another album Don Anderson!

#### Edge of Sanity - Crimson

Still love this album almost 15 years later. Swano sounds like he's drunk when he's doing clean vox.

#### Insomnium - Winter's Gate

Guess it's a day for long death metal songs. Guess this is good for what it is, not really my thing but I can see why people like it.

#### Hellhammer - Apocalyptic Raids

Influential for a reason. Dirty and raw and grimy, shit rules, it's kinda funny too with Tom's wild screams and gurgles.

#### Ulver - The Assassination of Julius Caesar

Definitely think this is one of the best things Ulver has ever done. It's got a very consistent sound but each track really stands out on its own. 'Rolling Stone' is a fave.

---

### February 3, 2020

#### Obsidian Tongue - A Nest of Ravens in the Throat of Time

Really like this, it's kinda experimental black metal that never deviates too far from the roots but is interesting and dynamic all the way through. Vocals are very Agalloch-esque. USBM sure owes a lot to Agalloch, doesn't it?

#### Akista - Grands Tyrans

What do you even call music like this, it's of course rooted in black metal but it's so much more!

---

### January 31, 2020

#### Panopticon/Nechochwen - Split

Another great 20 minute song from Panopticon, the emotion in here is very real and I dare say this might be one of the best things he's released. Nechochwen side is good too but I'm less familiar with them and need to listen more. I like their sound though.

#### Panopticon/Aerial Ruin - Split

Two Panopticon splits released in one day, oi vey! This one is his folky side, complimented wonderfully by Aerial Ruin. Aerial Ruin is better than ever here, some of my favorite songs he's recorded - love 'Lesser the Blade' especially. The Panopticon tracks are more countryish than some of his other releases, and that's ok because they're great too. The covers are the weakest tracks, though.

#### Ulver - Bergtatt

Well what more to say about this. The harsh vocals are like my least favorite part about it? I love Garm but I'm glad he pursued more clean singing later.

---

### January 30, 2020

#### Brånd - Urkraft

Wanna buy that cassette.

#### Cosmic Church - Vigilia

Been wanting to listen to this artist for a while, it doesn't disappoint! Good kinda atmospheric black metal, some really great riffs here, especially on the last track.

#### Ty Segall - First Taste

It's a Ty Segall album, definitely. No instant earworms but not a bad listen.

---

### January 29, 2020

#### Akitsa - Sang Nordique

I love these weirdos, an album that's very raw and harsh at times but also surprisingly laid back and chill at others. Like on 'La Nature De Mon Pays' which is basically a very distorted post-punk song and also my favorite on the album.

#### Book of Sand - How Beautiful to Walk Free

It's interesting to hear "experimental" black metal that is this raw. It's definitely a noisy chaotic mess, and the tracks kinda vary wildly in quality, but definitly worth a listen and I'm very interested to hear what else this band has done. Plus one for being anarchist vegans?

#### Departure Chandelier - The Black Crest of Death, The Gold Wreath of War

Found out this was recorded after their album and that makes a lot of sense. It's more refined, less sloppy, the songwriting tighter. The pace is slower but it's also more punky - there's no lack of fierce riffing here. The production is clearer, it's still pretty raw but you can hear everything well (especially the vocals). There synths are even more prominent, when they show up.

---

### January 28, 2020

#### Darken Wood - II

Got quite a lot of video game influence here, like the last track is called 'Hidden Temple' and sounds like Zelda music! It's good though, really ethereal and unique stuff.

#### Bellkeeper - The First Flame of Lordran

One of my favorite dungeon synth albums, I can't wait to hear more from Roland the Recluse (his other project Hole Dweller is insanely good too).

---

### January 24, 2020

#### Cryptopsy - None So Vile

Probably the best death metal album that ever will be, it's just perfect in every way.

#### Diabolical Masquerade - Death's Design

A neat album I never listened to enough. Jumps all over the place but manages to flow pretty well. The main riff is very memorable.

#### Sculptured - The Spear of the Lily is Aureoled

A pretty incredible debut from a very underrated band.

#### Agalloch - The Mantle

This really is like the best album ever arghhh.

---

### January 22, 2020

#### Khôrada - Salt

Really neat, creative stuff, no clue what genre to call this. Last track is my favorite, sounds like goth rock almost.

#### Constellatia - The Language of Limbs

Shades of the 90s Norwegian black metal innovators here, In The Woods... and Ved Buens Ende and the like. A bit disjointed and the drums are not mixed well but it's a good album that gets better as it goes on.

#### Twilight Force - Tales of Ancient Prophecies

Lol goofy shit. I guess it's fun but a little uninspired and not very memorable. Will try their later albums though.

#### Cobalt - Slow Forever

Ain't nothing out there that really sounds like Cobalt. Black metal with big Neurosis and Tool vibes. It's grimy, it's sludgy, it's one-of-a-kind.

---

### January 21, 2020

#### King's X - Dogman

Cool album, it's like heavy prog-grunge. Never listened to King's X before. Just love that title, 'Dogman.'

#### Toxic Holocaust - Primal Future: 2019

Never got much into thrash or crossover but this shit rips, it's super fun and groovy. Interestingly it's not too fast, kinda mid-paced? It works well, the focus isn't on speed so much as the riffs and the songwriting which really shine.

---

### January 17, 2020

#### Saint Vitus - Saint Vitus

The 1984 one. Super great. It's slow and sloppy and produced really weirdly, the guitars sound like they're underwater. I love it.

#### Darkest House - Undoing Ruin

10/10, flawless album, 'Convalescence' probably my favorite track but it's hard to pick!

---

### January 16, 2020

#### Warning - Watching From a Distance

A very good album for when you're slightly hungover and don't want to be at work.

#### Hammers of Misfortune - The Bastard

Having mostly-short songs that go all over the place is an interesting choice here. I like it, really lets the album tell a story.

---

### January 15, 2020

#### Agalloch - The Serpent and the Sphere

I think it's good that Agalloch called it quits when they did. They made some amazing music but by this album kinda felt like they were running out of ideas. It's not bad, just...uninspired? Better than the previous one, at least. Dekker is a killer drummer tho.

#### Woods of Ypres - Woods 5: Grey Skies & Electric Light

An eerie album, it is as if David Gold knew...

#### Witchlords - Demons in the Dark

Good old school speed metal with kinda wonky production - like it's trying to sound old but kinda just sounds weak? Not much low end. Still very fun!

#### Agent Steel - Skeptics Apocalypse

Listening to any speed metal just makes me want to listen to this again.

---

### January 14, 2020

#### Tiny Mouse - Little One's Journey

Hell yeah mouse synth

#### Tiny Mouse - The Happiest Mouse Alive

Hell yeah mouse synth pt 2

#### Darken Wood - I

Really like this, very eerie and creepy but still kinda cozy. Very much nails the feeling of being lost in a weird dark wood. Cool that's there's a few more albums!

#### Bloodlord - Unwelcome Guests

Makes me wanna get a cool little toy keyboard.

#### Obsequiae - Aria of Vernal Tombs

I think this one is not quite as good as the more recent one but still killer.

---

### January 13, 2020

#### Green Carnation - Light of Day, Day of Darkness

One of my favorite prog songs, one that really justifies itself being an hour long. Love love love the vocals.

#### Subterranean Masquerade - Vagabond

Totally did not know Green Carnation's vocalist sang on this (and their last one)!? Whatta coincidence. I dunno about this album, don't love the direction their music took. The 'Space Oddity' cover I could do without too.

#### Pain of Salvation - Remedy Lane Remixed

Not exactly sure what is remixed about this - better production I guess - but then again I haven't listened to Remedy Lane is a long time! 10 years? Something like that. Still love it though, second favorite PoS album after The Perfect Element Pt 1.

#### Panopticon - Autumn Eternal

Everything Panopticon has released is gold and this is no exception. Really focuses on atmosphere and the melancholy feel.

#### Bathory - Bathory

\m/

---

### January 10, 2020

#### Brånd - Urkraft

Really cool, lo-fi post-punk/black metal? I love stuff like this. Many more listens to come.

#### Autumn Heart - The Deaths of Summer

Def. one of the coolest things to come out last year. Very unique.

#### Sequestered Keep - The Vale of Ruined Towers

Another "not my fave but very well done" dungeon synth release.

#### Ayreon - The Final Experiment

In some ways this is my favorite Ayreon album. It's a lot more constrained than the later stuff, but still with all the stuff that make Ayreon unique. Maybe I just like the story the most.

---

### January 9, 2020

#### Balrog - The Shadow and the Flame

Very well done though I don't like it all that much - too abstract for me. It's interesting, doesn't invoke Tolkien very much though.

---

### January 8, 2020

#### Obsequiae - The Palms of Sorrowed Kings

Def. one of my favorite albums of last year. 'In the Garden of Hyacinths' gotta be the best song here.

#### Windir - Soknardalr

Saw a list on RYM recently that was like "It's Windir." and yeah that's about right.

#### Akitsa - Credo

These guys are at the top of their game. Great album, each song has its own distinct feel, from punky to epic. Pretty impressive given what they're working with. Favorite track 'Credo.'

---

### January 7, 2020

#### Secret Stairways - Enchantment of the Ring

I wanna know what he made this one. Such neat sounds.

#### Earthencloak - Pipe Smoke & Faery Magick

This album starts off very whimsical and gets rather dark by the end. Interesting progression.

#### Fief - II

Well I see why this is such a big name in dungeon synth. It's insanely well done. I prefer the more lo-fi stuff but big props to Fief.

#### Camp Cope - How to Socialise & Make Friends

Nice music, not my favorite in this style (don't really like the vocalist too much) but it's a pleasant listen!

#### Electrelane - No Shouts, No Calls

'Cut and Run' is one of my favorite songs ever and the rest of the album is cool too. It's well-paced and each song is pretty unique.

#### Bellkeeper - The First Flame of Lordran

Damn this album is REALLY good. There's so much going on and the songs all evolve and build on themselves so well.

#### Xasthur - Nocturnal Poisoning

Never really listened to Xasthur that much, didn't get into it when it came out. His early-mid 2000s black metal stuff is quite good, though! It's like music from a crawlspace.

---

### January 6, 2020

#### The Magnetic Fields - 69 Love Songs

Never listened to this in one sitting before. First time for everything! There's some very good and dear songs here, some kinda stinkers, and everything inbetween. To be expected. It's a monumental work and one of the best albums of the 90s.

---

### January 3, 2020

#### Hedge Wizard - More True Than Time Thought

My second favorite dungeon synth album of 2019. 'Conjurer's Clutter' def. my favorite track. Really interesting music, multilayered with multiple melodies weaving in and out.

#### Grandma's Cottage - Grandma's Cottage

Cozy is the word. Love the synth sounds.

#### Medhelan - The Minstrel's Fireplace Tales

Very accurately named. How do they get all the medieval sounds? Are these real instruments?

#### Borg - The Triumph of Spring

Quirky medieval folk music? Is really cool.

#### Vandalorum - Flagellum Dei

I should listen to the tape I have of this guy he's good.

---

### January 2, 2020

#### Funereal Presence - Achatius

Really cool album, very creative, love all the weird shit and kinda incoherent songwriting - have seen this described as an alternate history for what 90s black metal could have come to and that's very accurate. Will require much more listening.

#### Dissection - Storm Of The Light's Bane

One of those classic albums I never listened to before now. It's pretty good, definitely not my favorite of the time and place but I get the influence this must have had. It's got a sort of "subdued epic" feel and is almost...neoclassical? at times.

#### Departure Chandelier - Antichrist Rise to Power

My #1 album of 2019 so gotta listen to it here in 2020. Loving the synths this time around.

#### Ved Buens Ende - Written in Waters

Just noticed one of the tracks is a Proust reference lol as if this album couldn't get any better.

#### Blut Aus Nord - Memoria Vetusta I - Fathers Of The Icy Age

Extremely good, somehow BAN has remained one of the top bands in extreme metal for 25 years now. Vindsval can do no wrong.
