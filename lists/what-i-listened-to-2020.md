## Keeping track of what I've been listening to, maybe some comments

### January 7, 2020

#### Secret Stairways - Enchantment of the Ring

I wanna know what he made this one. Such neat sounds.

#### Earthencloak - Pipe Smoke & Faery Magick

This album starts off very whimsical and gets rather dark by the end. Interesting progression.

#### Fief - II

Well I see why this is such a big name in dungeon synth. It's insanely well done. I prefer the more lo-fi stuff but big props to Fief.

#### Camp Cope - How to Socialise & Make Friends

Nice music, not my favorite in this style (don't really like the vocalist too much) but it's a pleasant listen!

#### Electrelane - No Shouts, No Calls

'Cut and Run' is one of my favorite songs ever and the rest of the album is cool too. It's well-paced and each song is pretty unique.

#### Bellkeeper - The First Flame of Lordran

Damn this album is REALLY good. There's so much going on and the songs all evolve and build on themselves so well.

#### Xasthur - Nocturnal Poisoning

Never really listened to Xasthur that much, didn't get into it when it came out. His early-mid 2000s black metal stuff is quite good, though! It's like music from a crawlspace.

#### The Magnetic Fields - 69 Love Songs

Never listened to this in one sitting before. First time for everything! There's some very good and dear songs here, some kinda stinkers, and everything inbetween. To be expected. It's a monumental work and one of the best albums of the 90s.

#### Hedge Wizard - More True Than Time Thought

My second favorite dungeon synth album of 2019. 'Conjurer's Clutter' def. my favorite track. Really interesting music, multilayered with multiple melodies weaving in and out.

#### Grandma's Cottage - Grandma's Cottage

Cozy is the word. Love the synth sounds.

#### Medhelan - The Minstrel's Fireplace Tales

Very accurately named. How do they get all the medieval sounds? Are these real instruments?

#### Borg - The Triumph of Spring

Quirky medieval folk music? Is really cool.

#### Vandalorum - Flagellum Dei

I should listen to the tape I have of this guy he's good.

### January 2, 2020

#### Funereal Presence - Achatius

Really cool album, very creative, love all the weird shit and kinda incoherent songwriting - have seen this described as an alternate history for what 90s black metal could have come to and that's very accurate. Will require much more listening.

#### Dissection - Storm Of The Light's Bane

One of those classic albums I never listened to before now. It's pretty good, definitely not my favorite of the time and place but I get the influence this must have had. It's got a sort of "subdued epic" feel and is almost...neoclassical? at times.

#### Departure Chandelier - Antichrist Rise to Power

My #1 album of 2019 so gotta listen to it here in 2020. Loving the synths this time around.

#### Ved Buens Ende - Written in Waters

Just noticed one of the tracks is a Proust reference lol as if this album couldn't get any better.

#### Blut Aus Nord - Memoria Vetusta I - Fathers Of The Icy Age

Extremely good, somehow BAN has remained one of the top bands in extreme metal for 25 years now. Vindsval can do no wrong.
