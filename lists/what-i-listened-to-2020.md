# WHAT DID YOU LISTEN TO TODAY?

## Keeping track of what I've been listening to, maybe some comments

### January 16, 2020

#### Warning - Watching From a Distance

A very good album for when you're slightly hungover and don't want to be at work.

#### Hammers of Misfortune - The Bastard

Having mostly-short songs that go all over the place is an interesting choice here. I like it, really lets the album tell a story.

#### Agalloch - The Serpent and the Sphere

I think it's good that Agalloch called it quits when they did. They made some amazing music but by this album kinda felt like they were running out of ideas. It's not bad, just...uninspired? Better than the previous one, at least. Dekker is a killer drummer tho.

#### Woods of Ypres - Woods 5: Grey Skies & Electric Light

An eerie album, it is as if David Gold knew...

#### Witchlords - Demons in the Dark

Good old school speed metal with kinda wonky production - like it's trying to sound old but kinda just sounds weak? Not much low end. Still very fun!

#### Agent Steel - Skeptics Apocalypse

Listening to any speed metal just makes me want to listen to this again.

#### Tiny Mouse - Little One's Journey

Hell yeah mouse synth

#### Tiny Mouse - The Happiest Mouse Alive

Hell yeah mouse synth pt 2

#### Darken Wood - I

Really like this, very eerie and creepy but still kinda cozy. Very much nails the feeling of being lost in a weird dark wood. Cool that's there's a few more albums!

#### Bloodlord - Unwelcome Guests

Makes me wanna get a cool little toy keyboard.

#### Obsequiae - Aria of Vernal Tombs

I think this one is not quite as good as the more recent one but still killer.

#### Green Carnation - Light of Day, Day of Darkness

One of my favorite prog songs, one that really justifies itself being an hour long. Love love love the vocals.

#### Subterranean Masquerade - Vagabond

Totally did not know Green Carnation's vocalist sang on this (and their last one)!? Whatta coincidence. I dunno about this album, don't love the direction their music took. The 'Space Oddity' cover I could do without too.

#### Pain of Salvation - Remedy Lane Remixed

Not exactly sure what is remixed about this - better production I guess - but then again I haven't listened to Remedy Lane is a long time! 10 years? Something like that. Still love it though, second favorite PoS album after The Perfect Element Pt 1.

#### Panopticon - Autumn Eternal

Everything Panopticon has released is gold and this is no exception. Really focuses on atmosphere and the melancholy feel.

#### Bathory - Bathory

### January 10, 2020

#### Br√•nd - Urkraft

Really cool, lo-fi post-punk/black metal? I love stuff like this. Many more listens to come.

#### Autumn Heart - The Deaths of Summer

Def. one of the coolest things to come out last year. Very unique.

#### Sequestered Keep - The Vale of Ruined Towers

Another "not my fave but very well done" dungeon synth release.

#### Ayreon - The Final Experiment

In some ways this is my favorite Ayreon album. It's a lot more constrained than the later stuff, but still with all the stuff that make Ayreon unique. Maybe I just like the story the most.

#### Balrog - The Shadow and the Flame

Very well done though I don't like it all that much - too abstract for me. It's interesting, doesn't invoke Tolkien very much though.

---

### January 8, 2020

#### Obsequiae - The Palms of Sorrowed Kings

Def. one of my favorite albums of last year. 'In the Garden of Hyacinths' gotta be the best song here.

#### Windir - Soknardalr

Saw a list on RYM recently that was like "It's Windir." and yeah that's about right.

#### Akitsa - Credo

These guys are at the top of their game. Great album, each song has its own distinct feel, from punky to epic. Pretty impressive given what they're working with. Favorite track 'Credo.'

### January 7, 2020

#### Secret Stairways - Enchantment of the Ring

I wanna know what he made this one. Such neat sounds.

#### Earthencloak - Pipe Smoke & Faery Magick

This album starts off very whimsical and gets rather dark by the end. Interesting progression.

#### Fief - II

Well I see why this is such a big name in dungeon synth. It's insanely well done. I prefer the more lo-fi stuff but big props to Fief.

#### Camp Cope - How to Socialise & Make Friends

Nice music, not my favorite in this style (don't really like the vocalist too much) but it's a pleasant listen!

#### Electrelane - No Shouts, No Calls

'Cut and Run' is one of my favorite songs ever and the rest of the album is cool too. It's well-paced and each song is pretty unique.

#### Bellkeeper - The First Flame of Lordran

Damn this album is REALLY good. There's so much going on and the songs all evolve and build on themselves so well.

#### Xasthur - Nocturnal Poisoning

Never really listened to Xasthur that much, didn't get into it when it came out. His early-mid 2000s black metal stuff is quite good, though! It's like music from a crawlspace.

### January 6, 2020

#### The Magnetic Fields - 69 Love Songs

Never listened to this in one sitting before. First time for everything! There's some very good and dear songs here, some kinda stinkers, and everything inbetween. To be expected. It's a monumental work and one of the best albums of the 90s.

### January 3, 2020

#### Hedge Wizard - More True Than Time Thought

My second favorite dungeon synth album of 2019. 'Conjurer's Clutter' def. my favorite track. Really interesting music, multilayered with multiple melodies weaving in and out.

#### Grandma's Cottage - Grandma's Cottage

Cozy is the word. Love the synth sounds.

#### Medhelan - The Minstrel's Fireplace Tales

Very accurately named. How do they get all the medieval sounds? Are these real instruments?

#### Borg - The Triumph of Spring

Quirky medieval folk music? Is really cool.

#### Vandalorum - Flagellum Dei

I should listen to the tape I have of this guy he's good.

### January 2, 2020

#### Funereal Presence - Achatius

Really cool album, very creative, love all the weird shit and kinda incoherent songwriting - have seen this described as an alternate history for what 90s black metal could have come to and that's very accurate. Will require much more listening.

#### Dissection - Storm Of The Light's Bane

One of those classic albums I never listened to before now. It's pretty good, definitely not my favorite of the time and place but I get the influence this must have had. It's got a sort of "subdued epic" feel and is almost...neoclassical? at times.

#### Departure Chandelier - Antichrist Rise to Power

My #1 album of 2019 so gotta listen to it here in 2020. Loving the synths this time around.

#### Ved Buens Ende - Written in Waters

Just noticed one of the tracks is a Proust reference lol as if this album couldn't get any better.

#### Blut Aus Nord - Memoria Vetusta I - Fathers Of The Icy Age

Extremely good, somehow BAN has remained one of the top bands in extreme metal for 25 years now. Vindsval can do no wrong.
