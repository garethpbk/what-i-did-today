# WHAT DID YOU LISTEN TO TODAY?

## Keeping track of what I've been listening to, maybe some comments

---

### September 24, 2019

#### Electric Citizen - Sateen

As far as 2010s-era-Black-Sabbath-esque-bands-with-a-woman-singing go, this one is pretty solid. Nothing revolutionary but it's fun and catchy. The slower track 'Hawk Nightingale' is probably the weakest, they're best when they're rocking out. There are some more interesting bits like the bongo (?) breakdown on 'Burning in Hell,' which is the best track on the album.

#### Brocas Helm - Black Death

Pretty good but the production is a bit of a drag (and inconsistent). Maybe it was an intentional choice to have the vox sound faded and weak on tracks like 'Fly High' but I don't much like it. The album has a really _weird_ sound, and one wonders if that was on purpose, or just a side effect of the production? On the plus side the bass is usually strong, and there's enough excellent guitar work here to make this one a keeper.

#### Cirith Ungol - King of the Dead

There is something very funny about a band named after Lord of the Rings that used Michael Moorcock book covers for their album art. Cirith Ungol loved both and so do I. Their music is good too. The vocals take a bit to get used to, but it's fitting for the type of stuff they're doing. A legendary band, this is possibly their best album.

#### Hammers of Misfortune - The Bastard

An underrated group if ever there was one, this album's all over the place. So many cool ideas and different styles brought in. Only weakness is the harsh vocals which are just not well done.

#### Graveyard - Graveyard

Cool Swede rock n' roll. The songs kinda blend together but there's some great ones like 'Satan's Finest' and 'Blue Soul.'

#### Warning - Watching From a Distance

I wiiisshhh that yooouu were with me toooooniiigghhttt...

### September 23, 2019

#### Black Sabbath - Master of Reality

It would be fair to say that no one ever did it better than this album.

#### Flower Travellin' Band - Satori

Wild stuff, ahead-of-its-time, etc etc etc.

#### Manilla Road - Crystal Logic

One of my fave heavy metal albums. The duo of 'Necropolis'/'Crystal Logic' is something I could listen to over and over.

#### Manilla Road - Mystification

A little more sophisticated, a little faster. Not my fave of theirs but a solid album no doubt.

#### Darkthrone - Under a Funeral Moon

Occupies a weird place. On one hand it's got riffs and beats and solos that wouldn't be out of place on a death metal release, e.g. Soulside Journey. On the other there's plenty to hint at the sound that would come into maturity with Transilvanian Hunger. There's even like, breakdowns? I guess the progression from SJ -> Blaze -> this -> TH is pretty clear but it's very interesting. Honestly it sounds more like early Bathory than anything else. Sometimes. But then there's weird shit like the last track that doesn't sound like anything else.

### September 20, 2019

#### Witchfinder General - Death Penalty

So good I listened to it again. The Black Sabbath influence is obvious but they got their own sound. I think this band is highly underrated for how influential they were.

#### Count Raven - Storm Warning

An album from 1990 that sounds like it should have come out 5 years earlier. Don't mean that as a criticism, it really nails the Sabbath-worship sound.

#### Trespasser - Suffer Alone, Suffer Together

Apparently there are two crusty bands called Trespasser? This is the Australian one. It's pretty straightforward sludgy hardcore/crusty metal/whatever, it's heavy and it's nice to listen to.

#### Panopticon - Kentucky

Probably the best and most important USBM act around, at least my favorite. I remember when this came out in 2012 and being like, wtf, banjos, in my black metal!? But this is an American artist embracing America's own folk music, and it works wonderfully. This album's a bit more rough than the later ones, the vastly different musical styles don't quite mesh together as well sometimes, but that's a minor nitpick - it's amazing, emotional music with a fantastic pro-worker message. Austin Lunn is the man. I hope he keeps making music forever.

#### Ulver - Bergtatt

Ulver's original trilogy will always be my favorite thing they've done and some of my favorite music ever. This album feels so far ahead of its time.

#### Ulver - Kveldssanger

Part 2 is just as good as the first. Didn't make it to Nattens Madrigal today. Maybe later.

---

### September 19, 2019

#### Dopelord - Magick Rites

These guys rule, I like that they're not very aggressive but still heavy.

#### Witchfinder General - Death Penalty

I need to listen to this band (and their contemporaries) more. So fuckin good.

---

### September 18, 2019

#### Conan - Blood Eagle

Not sure what to think, it's sort of awkwardly in between being heavy slow doomy stuff and faster rocky stuff? But can't decide which? I _like_ it but on first listen not very memorable.

#### Kayo Dot - Blue Lambency Downward

Idk, one of my least favorite Kayo Dot releases. Don't care much for the jazzy influences and all the woodwinds.

#### Wolves in the Throne Room - Diadem of 12 Stars

What do you get when you take some nature-loving Cascadian metallers who really like Weakling? Some sick as hell music that's what. You can cry about how it doesn't do anything new or is derivative or whatever, who gives a shit, it's really tight, inspired music that succeeds 100% in what it's trying to do. Throw it up there with "Pale Folklore" as some of the best stuff to come out of the PNW. Never listened to their later stuff much, maybe it's good too, but I could spin this one all day.

---

### September 16, 2019

#### Wampyric Rites - Demo II

Good stuff, production is just right for this kinda thing. Synth tracks are meh, guitars are real good.

---

### September 13, 2019

#### Bell Witch - Mirror Reaper

Probably the best thing they have released, at least my favorite. Very moving. I don't know what to even call this music, post-doom metal? But not like "post-metal" that's more like atmospheric sludge like Cult of Luna or whatever. This is like post-traditional-doom-metal. Warning on dramamine. Whatver it's cool as hell and I can't wait to see what they do next.

#### Atlantean Kodex - The Course of Empire

This is actually kinda disappointing on first listen. The production is more complex, lots of layers and backing vocals and stuff, but I don't think the music benefits from it...nothing is quite as memorable, everything feels a bit slower. Their lyrics are definitely dumb as hell too oooh ahh ~ ever westward, the course of empire ~ dumb shit y'all. All this said I'll give it some more listens because I don't think it's _bad_ necessarily.

### September 12, 2019

#### Atlantean Kodex - The Golden Bough

The only two bands I know of who acknowledge being directly inspired by Robert Graves are these guys and, oddly enough, Protest the Hero. The Golden Bough, the book, has been sitting on my shelf for a few weeks now, after I picked it up at a used bookstore. Been meaning to read it for a while. Anyway, this album is really great, epic historical metal and it's a nice bonus that it touches on my literary interests. Some of the lyrical content is...troubling, but the history it's referencing is troubling too ("Saracen hordes," huh). Apparently their latest album deals with non-European history so that'll be a nice change.

#### Atlantean Kodex - The White Goddess

And now the one actually named after Graves's book. I eagerly await "The Witch-Cult in Western Europe" to complete the trifecta of "20th century Western folklore books that are all bullshit but I still believe in them." Yes I kow the Golden Bough was published in 1890 ok. Anyway this album owns too. "Sol Invictus" is far and away the best track, a bold decision to open the album with it, but the rest is pretty good too. Some troubling stuff here too, maybe go lighter on the Churchill next time y'all?

#### Bathory - Blood Fire Death

I think this era Bathory may be my favorite Bathory. Got all the epicness of the later stuff and all the heaviness of the earlier. "A Fine Day to Die" is my favorite Bathory track.

---

### September 11, 2019

#### Emperor - Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk

Have I mentioned that I love this album? It might be my favorite of the 90s Norwegian second wave. I know I said Transilvanian Hunger was earlier but this one is too. It's such a neat sound, innovative and symphonic without sounding cheap or weak. "With Strength I Burn" it probably the standout track. Later Emperor albums and Ihsahn's solo stuff never did it for me, but this one is a true classic 10/10.

---

### September 10, 2019

#### Brocas Helm - Defender of the Crown

I find this kind of heavy metal kind of hit or miss and this one's definitely a hit. Wish these guys had kept making more music.

#### Emperor & Thorns - Emperor vs Thorns

No clue what to think of this. I like both of the groups but this feels...unnecessary?

---

### September 9, 2019

#### Dawn Ray'd - A Thorn, A Blight

Their sound suits their politics well. Not my favorite, but I'll listen to their other stuff for sure.

#### Mizmor - Cairn

Been waiting for this one for a while despite never listening to his earlier stuff much. It's neat, definitely music for a certain mood. Very dooooooom.

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

Supposedly Euronymous hated these guys, right? Probably was just jealous of 'em and how much better they were at making interesting, original music. It's like Bathory on cough syrup.

#### Darkspace - Dark I

Coolest stuff ever. Cold as space. Tbh I could do without the samples.

---

### September 6, 2019

#### Witch Vomit - Poisoned Blood

The OSDM revival thing is neat. Not my favorite kind of music and tbh it all kinda runs together for me but these guys are hella solid.

#### Kayo Dot - Blasphemy

What can you expect from a new Kayo Dot record? That it won't really sound like anything they've put out before, or probably anything else. Holds true here. Gonna have to listen to it a few more times to form a solid opinion, but first impression is positive. More interesting songwriting than their last album, an exploration of styles ranging from darkwave to prog rock to vague metal-adjacent...something. Choirs of the Eye will probably always be my favorite of theirs, but forever kudos to Toby Driver for always looking forward.

#### Armagedda - I Am

Not their best work but it's a fun little EP.

#### Alcest - Le Secrete

I've listened to this so many times and to be honest I don't love it but it's a nice thing and I am glad it exists.

---

### September 5, 2019

#### Darkthrone - Transilvanian Hunger

For my money the best of the second wave Norwegian albums that came out around this time. If someone were to ask "what is black metal" this is the album I'd point them to.

#### Mayhem - De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas

Tight riffing and drumming! The guitar tone on this album is so weird. It's like weak but powerful simultaneously. I love this album. Funeral Fog remains the only Mayhem song I ever learned to play all of the riffs for consistently, many years ago...

#### Armagedda - Only True Believers

This is like, rock n' roll black metal. Not 'black n roll' or whatever, just black metal with some really rockin' punky riffage. Mid-late 2000s Darkthrone kinda sounds like this (and parts of it sound like 90s Darkthrone), wouldn't be surprised if Fenriz was a fan. There's also some slower songs that are executed just as well. A well-rounded album.

##### Rotting Christ - Triarchy of the Lost Lovers

Never listened to this band before, but I like this a lot! The gothy sound is great, there's all kinds of stuff going on here. Pinch harmonics, blast beats and stuff, but there's a really solid foundation under it all.

##### Drudkh - Autumn Aurora

Turns out Drudkh is basically nsbm, welp, gotta stop listening to them :/

---

### September 4, 2019

#### Mayhem - Wolf's Lair Abyss

Pretty cool really. Mayhem was always a pretty weird band and this is a good example of that.

#### Panopticon - The Crescendo of Dusk

A nice EP, Panopticon's "leftover" tracks are still great.

---

### September 3, 2019

#### Falls of Rauros - Hail Wind and Hewn Oak

Probably my favorite FoR album. The Agalloch influence is strong, but their sound is very much their own. Just the right amount of "folk" elements balanced with great black metal instrumentation and vocals.

#### Mutiilation - Hail Satanas We Are the Black Legions

I am pretty meh about LLN in general. This one's fun though. Nice punchy riffs.

#### Nuit Noire/His Electro Blue Voice

Pretty good split, a good pairing. NN's weirdass fairy music goes well with HEBV's sound.

#### Bathory - Bathory

RIP Quorthon one of the all-time greats. Pretty sick

#### Bathory - Under the Sign of the Black Mark

#### Bathory - Blood Fire Death

Today is a Bathory day, eh.

---

### August 30, 2019

#### Immortal - Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism

Never liked Immortal as much as some of their comrades but definitely a good album, gotta listen to more Immortal.

#### Burzum - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss

What to say about this album, about Burzum? It's a classic, Varg is a piece of shit bad idiot, people will argue about whether you can enjoy art made by bad people until the sun burns out.

#### Leviathan - The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide

Hey, another "I love this album, too bad the artist is an asshole." A good example of what one talented person with a four track recorder can do.

---

### August 29, 2019

#### Tool - Aenima

Imagine a Tool that took the sound of this album and expanded on it. I love Lateralus and 10,000 Days is pretty great, but what could have been! "H." might be my favorite Tool song.

#### Emperor - In The Nightside Eclipse

I think this one and the next are masterpieces and I could do without the rest. I AM THEM!

---

### August 28, 2019

#### Blut Aus Nord - Deus Salutis Meae

Idk, it's definitely a BAN album. Would have to listen more but if you like their weird black metal/industrial sound this is moreof that. Not a big fan of the vocals.

#### Falls of Rauros - Patterns in Mythology

This album kicks ass. FoR are doing their own thing, they've got their own unique sound. It's black metal, it's uplifting (and not in a blackgaze way), it's complex, layered music.

---

### August 26, 2019

#### Tool - Fear Inoculum

It's good! Better than expected! A very mature sounding album that merits many re-listens. Definitely sounds like the summation of their career to this point. Here's hoping they will keep making more music...just not 13 years from now.

#### Weakling - Dead As Dreams

Holy shit! What an album! A true classic, lots of stuff inspired by this but nothing quite like it. The RIFFS are so good.

---

### August 22, 2019

#### Slough Feg - Digital Resistance

It's definitely a Slough Feg album.

#### Slough Feg - Ape Uprising

A heavier, super rockin' Slough Feg album. Some neat doomy influences.

#### Slough Feg - Down Among the Deadmen

A Slough Feg kinda day!

#### Immortal Bird - Thrive on Neglect

Really cool album. Need to listen more.

---

### August 21, 2019

#### Bolt Thrower - Those Once Loyal

BOLT THROWER!

---

### August 20, 2019

#### Ved Buens Ende - Written in Waters

Still nothing that sounds quite like it.

#### Mastodon - Emperor of Sand

Idk, the 'heavy' songs are pretty weak and the 'rock' songs are pretty boring.

#### Cobalt - Gin

A really cool album from a really unique band. Think I prefer 'Slow Forever' on the whole but this one's a keeper.

---

### August 19, 2019

#### Nocturnus - The Key

One of the coolest old death metal albums there is. Space metal!

#### Darkthrone - A Blaze in the Northern Sky

Classic.

#### Cryptopsy - None So Vile

The best album from one of the best death metal bands of the 90s.

##### Windir - 1184

Imagine what could have been if Valfar was not taken so early. A wonderful, unique album that transcends black metal into something all its own.

##### Dead Congregation - Graves of the Archangels

Need to listen more. Would call it "a solid death metal album."

---

### August 16, 2019

#### Bosse-de-Nage - Further Still

One of the better 'blackgaze' groups out there...not the most _interesting_ music but solid execution. Not a huge fan of the vocals, yes of the drumming.

---

### August 15, 2019

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

A classic of early black metal...nothing else quite like it. Imagine what the genre would have been like if these guys were influential in the way that Darkthrone, Burzum, etc. were.

#### Beherit - Engram

A hell of a comeback album. "How to make an old-school album in the modern era without sounding like a cheap tribute band" 101 here.

##### Warning - Watching from a Distance

An immense album, a modern doom classic.
