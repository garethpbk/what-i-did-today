#### Bosse-de-Nage - Further Still

One of the better 'blackgaze' groups out there...not the most _interesting_ music but solid execution. Not a huge fan of the vocals, yes of the drumming.

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

A classic of early black metal...nothing else quite like it. Imagine what the genre would have been like if these guys were influential in the way that Darkthrone, Burzum, etc. were.

#### Beherit - Engram

A hell of a comeback album. "How to make an old-school album in the modern era without sounding like a cheap tribute band" 101 here.

##### Warning - Watching from a Distance

An immense album, a modern doom classic.
