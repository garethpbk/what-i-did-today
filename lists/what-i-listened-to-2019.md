# WHAT DID YOU LISTEN TO TODAY?

## Keeping track of what I've been listening to, maybe some comments

#### Atlantean Kodex - The Golden Bough

The only two bands I know of who acknowledge being directly inspired by Robert Graves are these guys and, oddly enough, Protest the Hero. The Golden Bough, the book, has been sitting on my shelf for a few weeks now, after I picked it up at a used bookstore. Been meaning to read it for a while. Anyway, this album is really great, epic historical metal and it's a nice bonus that it touches on my literary interests. Some of the lyrical content is...troubling, but the history it's referencing is troubling too ("Saracen hordes," huh). Apparently their latest album deals with non-European history so that'll be a nice change.

#### Atlantean Kodex - The White Goddess

And now the one actually named after Graves's book. I eagerly await "The Witch-Cult in Western Europe" to complete the trifecta of "20th century Western folklore books that are all bullshit but I still believe in them." Yes I kow the Golden Bough was published in 1890 ok. Anyway this album owns too. "Sol Invictus" is far and away the best track, a bold decision to open the album with it, but the rest is pretty good too. Some troubling stuff here too, maybe go lighter on the Churchill next time y'all?

#### Bathory - Blood Fire Death

I think this era Bathory may be my favorite Bathory. Got all the epicness of the later stuff and all the heaviness of the earlier. "A Fine Day to Die" is my favorite Bathory track.

#### Emperor - Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk

Have I mentioned that I love this album? It might be my favorite of the 90s Norwegian second wave. I know I said Transilvanian Hunger was earlier but this one is too. It's such a neat sound, innovative and symphonic without sounding cheap or weak. "With Strength I Burn" it probably the standout track. Later Emperor albums and Ihsahn's solo stuff never did it for me, but this one is a true classic 10/10.

### September 10, 2019

#### Brocas Helm - Defender of the Crown

I find this kind of heavy metal kind of hit or miss and this one's definitely a hit. Wish these guys had kept making more music.

#### Emperor & Thorns - Emperor vs Thorns

No clue what to think of this. I like both of the groups but this feels...unnecessary?

---

### September 9, 2019

#### Dawn Ray'd - A Thorn, A Blight

Their sound suits their politics well. Not my favorite, but I'll listen to their other stuff for sure.

#### Mizmor - Cairn

Been waiting for this one for a while despite never listening to his earlier stuff much. It's neat, definitely music for a certain mood. Very dooooooom.

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

Supposedly Euronymous hated these guys, right? Probably was just jealous of 'em and how much better they were at making interesting, original music. It's like Bathory on cough syrup.

#### Darkspace - Dark I

Coolest stuff ever. Cold as space. Tbh I could do without the samples.

---

### September 6, 2019

#### Witch Vomit - Poisoned Blood

The OSDM revival thing is neat. Not my favorite kind of music and tbh it all kinda runs together for me but these guys are hella solid.

#### Kayo Dot - Blasphemy

What can you expect from a new Kayo Dot record? That it won't really sound like anything they've put out before, or probably anything else. Holds true here. Gonna have to listen to it a few more times to form a solid opinion, but first impression is positive. More interesting songwriting than their last album, an exploration of styles ranging from darkwave to prog rock to vague metal-adjacent...something. Choirs of the Eye will probably always be my favorite of theirs, but forever kudos to Toby Driver for always looking forward.

#### Armagedda - I Am

Not their best work but it's a fun little EP.

#### Alcest - Le Secrete

I've listened to this so many times and to be honest I don't love it but it's a nice thing and I am glad it exists.

### September 5, 2019

#### Darkthrone - Transilvanian Hunger

For my money the best of the second wave Norwegian albums that came out around this time. If someone were to ask "what is black metal" this is the album I'd point them to.

#### Mayhem - De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas

Tight riffing and drumming! The guitar tone on this album is so weird. It's like weak but powerful simultaneously. I love this album. Funeral Fog remains the only Mayhem song I ever learned to play all of the riffs for consistently, many years ago...

#### Armagedda - Only True Believers

This is like, rock n' roll black metal. Not 'black n roll' or whatever, just black metal with some really rockin' punky riffage. Mid-late 2000s Darkthrone kinda sounds like this (and parts of it sound like 90s Darkthrone), wouldn't be surprised if Fenriz was a fan. There's also some slower songs that are executed just as well. A well-rounded album.

##### Rotting Christ - Triarchy of the Lost Lovers

Never listened to this band before, but I like this a lot! The gothy sound is great, there's all kinds of stuff going on here. Pinch harmonics, blast beats and stuff, but there's a really solid foundation under it all.

##### Drudkh - Autumn Aurora

Turns out Drudkh is basically nsbm, welp, gotta stop listening to them :/

---

### September 4, 2019

#### Mayhem - Wolf's Lair Abyss

Pretty cool really. Mayhem was always a pretty weird band and this is a good example of that.

#### Panopticon - The Crescendo of Dusk

A nice EP, Panopticon's "leftover" tracks are still great.

---

### September 3, 2019

#### Falls of Rauros - Hail Wind and Hewn Oak

Probably my favorite FoR album. The Agalloch influence is strong, but their sound is very much their own. Just the right amount of "folk" elements balanced with great black metal instrumentation and vocals.

#### Mutiilation - Hail Satanas We Are the Black Legions

I am pretty meh about LLN in general. This one's fun though. Nice punchy riffs.

#### Nuit Noire/His Electro Blue Voice

Pretty good split, a good pairing. NN's weirdass fairy music goes well with HEBV's sound.

#### Bathory - Bathory

RIP Quorthon one of the all-time greats. Pretty sick

#### Bathory - Under the Sign of the Black Mark

#### Bathory - Blood Fire Death

Today is a Bathory day, eh.

---

### August 30, 2019

#### Immortal - Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism

Never liked Immortal as much as some of their comrades but definitely a good album, gotta listen to more Immortal.

#### Burzum - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss

What to say about this album, about Burzum? It's a classic, Varg is a piece of shit bad idiot, people will argue about whether you can enjoy art made by bad people until the sun burns out.

#### Leviathan - The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide

Hey, another "I love this album, too bad the artist is an asshole." A good example of what one talented person with a four track recorder can do.

---

### August 29, 2019

#### Tool - Aenima

Imagine a Tool that took the sound of this album and expanded on it. I love Lateralus and 10,000 Days is pretty great, but what could have been! "H." might be my favorite Tool song.

#### Emperor - In The Nightside Eclipse

I think this one and the next are masterpieces and I could do without the rest. I AM THEM!

---

### August 28, 2019

#### Blut Aus Nord - Deus Salutis Meae

Idk, it's definitely a BAN album. Would have to listen more but if you like their weird black metal/industrial sound this is moreof that. Not a big fan of the vocals.

#### Falls of Rauros - Patterns in Mythology

This album kicks ass. FoR are doing their own thing, they've got their own unique sound. It's black metal, it's uplifting (and not in a blackgaze way), it's complex, layered music.

---

### August 26, 2019

#### Tool - Fear Inoculum

It's good! Better than expected! A very mature sounding album that merits many re-listens. Definitely sounds like the summation of their career to this point. Here's hoping they will keep making more music...just not 13 years from now.

#### Weakling - Dead As Dreams

Holy shit! What an album! A true classic, lots of stuff inspired by this but nothing quite like it. The RIFFS are so good.

---

### August 22, 2019

#### Slough Feg - Digital Resistance

It's definitely a Slough Feg album.

#### Slough Feg - Ape Uprising

A heavier, super rockin' Slough Feg album. Some neat doomy influences.

#### Slough Feg - Down Among the Deadmen

A Slough Feg kinda day!

#### Immortal Bird - Thrive on Neglect

Really cool album. Need to listen more.

---

### August 21, 2019

#### Bolt Thrower - Those Once Loyal

BOLT THROWER!

---

### August 20, 2019

#### Ved Buens Ende - Written in Waters

Still nothing that sounds quite like it.

#### Mastodon - Emperor of Sand

Idk, the 'heavy' songs are pretty weak and the 'rock' songs are pretty boring.

#### Cobalt - Gin

A really cool album from a really unique band. Think I prefer 'Slow Forever' on the whole but this one's a keeper.

---

### August 19, 2019

#### Nocturnus - The Key

One of the coolest old death metal albums there is. Space metal!

#### Darkthrone - A Blaze in the Northern Sky

Classic.

#### Cryptopsy - None So Vile

The best album from one of the best death metal bands of the 90s.

##### Windir - 1184

Imagine what could have been if Valfar was not taken so early. A wonderful, unique album that transcends black metal into something all its own.

##### Dead Congregation - Graves of the Archangels

Need to listen more. Would call it "a solid death metal album."

---

### August 16, 2019

#### Bosse-de-Nage - Further Still

One of the better 'blackgaze' groups out there...not the most _interesting_ music but solid execution. Not a huge fan of the vocals, yes of the drumming.

---

### August 15, 2019

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

A classic of early black metal...nothing else quite like it. Imagine what the genre would have been like if these guys were influential in the way that Darkthrone, Burzum, etc. were.

#### Beherit - Engram

A hell of a comeback album. "How to make an old-school album in the modern era without sounding like a cheap tribute band" 101 here.

##### Warning - Watching from a Distance

An immense album, a modern doom classic.
