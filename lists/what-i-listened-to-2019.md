# WHAT DID YOU LISTEN TO TODAY?

## Keeping track of what I've been listening to, maybe some comments

#### Tool - Aenima

Imagine a Tool that took the sound of this album and expanded on it. I love Lateralus and 10,000 Days is pretty great, but what could have been! "H." might be my favorite Tool song.

#### Emperor - In The Nightside Eclipse

I think this one and the next are masterpieces and I could do without the rest. I AM THEM!

#### Blut Aus Nord - Deus Salutis Meae

Idk, it's definitely a BAN album. Would have to listen more but if you like their weird black metal/industrial sound this is moreof that. Not a big fan of the vocals.

#### Falls of Rauros - Patterns in Mythology

This album kicks ass. FoR are doing their own thing, they've got their own unique sound. It's black metal, it's uplifting (and not in a blackgaze way), it's complex, layered music.

#### Tool - Fear Inoculum

It's good! Better than expected! A very mature sounding album that merits many re-listens. Definitely sounds like the summation of their career to this point. Here's hoping they will keep making more music...just not 13 years from now.

#### Weakling - Dead As Dreams

Holy shit! What an album! A true classic, lots of stuff inspired by this but nothing quite like it. The RIFFS are so good.

#### Slough Feg - Digital Resistance

It's definitely a Slough Feg album.

#### Slough Feg - Ape Uprising

A heavier, super rockin' Slough Feg album. Some neat doomy influences.

#### Slough Feg - Down Among the Deadmen

A Slough Feg kinda day!

#### Immortal Bird - Thrive on Neglect

Really cool album. Need to listen more.

#### Bolt Thrower - Those Once Loyal

BOLT THROWER!

### August 20, 2019

#### Ved Buens Ende - Written in Waters

Still nothing that sounds quite like it.

#### Mastodon - Emperor of Sand

Idk, the 'heavy' songs are pretty weak and the 'rock' songs are pretty boring.

#### Cobalt - Gin

A really cool album from a really unique band. Think I prefer 'Slow Forever' on the whole but this one's a keeper.

### August 19, 2019

#### Nocturnus - The Key

One of the coolest old death metal albums there is. Space metal!

#### Darkthrone - A Blaze in the Northern Sky

Classic.

#### Cryptopsy - None So Vile

The best album from one of the best death metal bands of the 90s.

##### Windir - 1184

Imagine what could have been if Valfar was not taken so early. A wonderful, unique album that transcends black metal into something all its own.

##### Dead Congregation - Graves of the Archangels

Need to listen more. Would call it "a solid death metal album."

### August 16, 2019

#### Bosse-de-Nage - Further Still

One of the better 'blackgaze' groups out there...not the most _interesting_ music but solid execution. Not a huge fan of the vocals, yes of the drumming.

---

### August 15, 2019

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

A classic of early black metal...nothing else quite like it. Imagine what the genre would have been like if these guys were influential in the way that Darkthrone, Burzum, etc. were.

#### Beherit - Engram

A hell of a comeback album. "How to make an old-school album in the modern era without sounding like a cheap tribute band" 101 here.

##### Warning - Watching from a Distance

An immense album, a modern doom classic.
