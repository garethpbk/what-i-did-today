# WHAT DID YOU LISTEN TO TODAY?

## Keeping track of what I've been listening to, maybe some comments

### December 20, 2019

#### Hobbit - Leaving the Shire

Cool another dungeon synth album about a Hobbit leaving the Shire. In this case it's very directly based on 'Fellowship.' It's ok but not something I feel much desire to lisetn to again - does a good job at hitting the appropriate themes for the songs, though 'Enter Rivendell' is a bit too bombastic and dark for my liking.

#### Autumn Heart - The Deaths of Summer

Closest thing I've heard to this is some French acts like Nuit Noire and Call Me Loretta. Not really that they sound like it, but similar vibes.

#### Velvet Cacoon - Genevieve

This is a desert island album, a one-of-a-kind achievement that'll never be exceeded at what it tries to do.

---

### December 19, 2019

#### Autumn Heart - The Deaths of Summer

Really cool, like raw post-black metal. The production works so well, the vocals are real cool. Strong contender for one of the best albums released this year. 'Old Storms Appear' is the best track, it is all over the place in a good way. 'We Wear The Old Masks, We Are You Again' sounds like black metal Sonic Youth lol.

#### Hedge Wizard - More True Than Time Thought

'Conjurer's Clutter' is the best track here, it's so aptly named and good.

#### Hole Dweller - Flies the Coop

Gonna be listening to this one a lot.

#### Serpent's Isle - Legends of the Ancient Bay

Does very well capturing a nautical atmosphere. Rough lo-fi dungeon synth is my favorite of the genre. Which is true for every other genre too I guess.

#### Falls of Rauros - Patterns in Mythology

This album is very good, better than I gave it credit for when I've listened to it before.

---

### December 18, 2019

#### Hole Dweller - Flies the Coop

One of the best dungeon synth albums I've heard, definitely (among) the best of 2019. Each track has its own story and the progression across the album is wild - you can really feel the journey from the comfortable Shire to more dangerous places. Listened twice. Favorite track is 'Have My Eyes Seen a Phantasm in the Shadow of Camp?,' it's eerie!

#### Burzum - Daudi Baldrs

I like this album. Its limitations are its strengths.

#### Secret Stairways - Enchantment of the Ring

This album is like that part in Diablo II when you're going up the stairs floating in space, except instead of stressful and violent it's relaxing and peaceful.

#### Earthencloak - Pipe Smoke & Faery Magick

Gnome synth indeed. Goes from very whimsical and light sounding to quite dark by the end. Title track is the standout.

#### Diplodocus - Slow And Heavy

Dinosaur synth. Pretty cool, very much sounds like old dinosaur movies. Calls to mind shitty models.

---

### December 17, 2019

#### Agalloch - The Mantle (Remastered)

Can't get the arpeggio parts of 'You Were But A Ghost In My Arms' outta my head...

#### Departure Chandelier - Antichrist Rise to Power

Got a drive that'll take a little over half an hour? Perfect album for that...I really am starting to appreciate the synth parts of this album a lot, it's cool when they take the lead like on the first track.

---

### December 16, 2019

#### Lunar Womb - The Sleeping Green

One of the best medieval/foresty synth things I've heard yet. Felt like I was lying down in an overgrown stone ruin in an old forest the whole time I was listening.

#### Leviathan - The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide

There is a lot of variety on this album. Parts are enough kind of beautiful, like the slow riffs and picking parts of 'The Idiot Sun.'

#### Bathory - Nordland I

I don't think I've ever listened to the Nordland albums before. Not my favorite style of music but it's fun, 'Foreverdark Woods' is my favorite track.

---

### December 13, 2019

#### Departure Chandelier - Antichrist Rise to Power

This is gonna become one of my most listened to albums ever lol. There is quite a bit of depth and variety to the songwriting here. None of the songs really sounds like any of the others - the riffs are constructed differently, there's different techniques being used.

---

### December 12, 2019

#### Saor - Roots

I tried listening to this guy before and couldn't get into it but I liked it this time. Very relaxing for the type of music it is.

#### Arcturus - Constellation

A unique release for its time no doubt, not something I have or will listen to too much tho. Shades of the band they would later become.

#### In the Woods... - Omnio

A real classic, one of the best metal albums ever, does everything it sets out to do and more.

#### Emperor - Reverence

Two very good Emperor songs. 'The Loss & Curse of Reverence' is one of their best.

---

### December 11, 2019

#### Keys of Orthanc - Dush Agh Golnauk

As long as black metal is around, people making it will be inspired by Lord of the Rings. Pretty good atmospheric stuff, nice raw sound with synths that aren't overdone. Gotta have the synthy intro and outro.

#### Windtower - The Eldest One

Medieval synth that's, dare I say, cute? At least 'One Last Merry Night' is. Not incredibly remarkable but a nice listen.

---

### December 10, 2019

#### Aerial Ruin - Namelss Sun

I've listened to this three times through now and it's great, very eerie but comforting.

#### Panopticon - The Scars of Man on the Once Nameless Wilderness, Part I

This is the album where Panopticon has completely honed its metal - it's an hour long but concise, there is not a single wasted second or note here. The interludes are brief and regulate the flow of the album well. 'Snow Burdened Branches' is one of the best songs he's ever put out. No one is making music quite like this and I don't know if anyone else could.

#### Departure Chandelier - Antichrist Rise to Power

I can't stop listening to this, it's so good! 'Forever Faithful to the Emperor' has one of my favorite metal riffs ever.

#### Guild of Lore - Winterstead

Cool sparkly synth music. Captures ye olde 12th-century-charcoal-burner aesthetic.

#### Rome - The Hyperion Machine

Interesing shift of direction for Rome. I'd call it a rock album, even. It's very nice and very melancholy, like all of his stuff, and feels a bit more personal and less political.

---

### December 6, 2019

#### Aerial Ruin - Nameless Sun

I really like this guy's voice. He definitely sings on some Bell Witch releases yeah? It's nice, sparse but rich music. A lot happens with just a voice and a guitar. The title track is my favorite.

#### Agalloch - The White EP

The remastered version, which I have never listened to, and has a bonus track. One of my favorite Agalloch releases - it's inconsistent and not every track is great, but they do a really nice job capturing the neofolk sound on songs like 'Sowilo Ruin' and my favorite 'Birch White.' One gets the feeling the band wrote these songs at different times, perhaps to be on different releases? The bonus track is pretty neat, incorporates a lot of stuff from the rest of the EP that's spread out over multiple songs.

#### Departure Chandelier - Antichrist Rise to Power

Raw black metal about Napolean, why not? It's actually really good, the riffs are super killer and the minimal production is great. I am really inspired by this. I like the vocals a lot, they're lower and more growly than typical black metal. The synths are cool.

#### Casket of Dreams - Dragons of Autumn Twilight

The book this is named after was one of my favorites as a kid. Doesn't quite hold up now, but whatever! This would be a great soundtrack for reading it. It's fun, upbeat but mysterious. Definitely going to listen more. Favorite track is 'The Serpent Race.' This is over 20 years old too :o

#### Departure Chandelier - The Black Crest of Death, The Gold Wreath of War

Surprisingly different from the LP - the songs are longer, a bit slower, and even less aggressive? Parts border on, dare I say, atmospheric.

---

### December 5, 2019

#### Old Tower - The Rise of the Spectral Horizons

What differentiates 'dungeon synth' from 'dark ambient'? With stuff like this it's hard to tell, it's kind of just a spooky dark ambient album. It's good and creates that mood well. I prefer my dungeon synth with more melody and beep boops, though.

#### Falls of Rauros - Believe in No Coming Shore

Their signature sound is very evident on this album, already. Where the first one sounds so much like Agalloch tribute (in a good way, I love it) this one is really different and contains the unique black metal style they'd run away with.

---

### December 4, 2019

#### Hedge Wizard - More True Than Time Thought

Great start to a rainy day.

#### Falls of Rauros - Hail Wind and Hewn Oak

I keep coming back to this album. It's so wonderfully unpolished, the guitar tone is so nice. And the riffs! The title track has one of my favorite riffs in all black metal. And the breakdown part in 'Of Stone and the Stars in the Sky'! They have evolved so much as a band but their roots were very strong too.

#### Blut Aus Nord - Hallucinogen

This album is so good! It's got the same kind of spiky melodies and leads that I love in Obsequiae. Vindsval continues to be one of the best musicians in metal of all time.

---

### December 3, 2019

#### Hedge Wizard - More True Than Time Thought

Really good dungeon synth. Going to listen to this one a lot more.

#### Blood Lord - Unwelcome Guests

The soundtrack to a lost Castlevania game. Fun music that does a great job telling a story with just a keyboard, pretty cool.

#### Paths of the Eternal - Search of True Ascendance

The last track here is really cool, love the vocals.

#### Erang - Within the Land of My Imagination I Am the Only God

This is an ambitious work with lots of great stuff to be found. It is inconsistent, though, and doesn't all mesh together as an album - perhaps too many different sounds here. Each track is interesting in itself for sure.

#### Manes - Slow Motion Death Sequence

Really like 'Chemical Heritage' and will have to listen more to judge the rest. It's a good sound though, I like their vocalists a lot.

---

### December 2, 2019

#### Forgotten Pathways - Shrouded in Mystery

Neat vocals and percussion.

#### In Gowan Ring - The Serpent and the Dove

I like, very woodsy, ye olde folky sounding.

#### Darkthrone - A Blaze in the Northern Sky

This is a pretty weird album. It's got this unique angular guitar sound, very buzzy and rough. There's guitar solos and killer riffs! The drumming is a lot more complex than on later DT black metal releases. Dare I say this album is...technical?

---

### November 27, 2019

#### Blood Ceremony - The Eldritch Dark

Has the most instantly memorable, catchy tracks of any Blood Ceremony album. 'Ballad of the Weird Sisters' and 'Drawing Down the Moon' are my favorites.

#### The Flight of Sleipnir - Skadi

Oooh I like this. Kind of like doomy atmospheric metal with black influences and vocals. Reminds me of a less-heavy, more melodic Inter Arma.

#### Dax Riggs - Say Goodnight to the World

A lot more accomplished and polished than his earlier solo albums - more bluesy, less rocky, slower in general. His voice has never been better.

#### The Magnetic Fields - The Charm of the Highway Strip

Songs about roads, yep.

#### The Magnetic Fields - i

Songs about i, yep. I appreciate how Merritt pronounces 'infinite.'

#### Neutral Milk Hotel - In the Aeroplane Over the Sea

Once upon a time, when I was...13? this was my favorite album. It is still very good. These days I notice how noisy and rough the production is. A real one-of-a-kind piece of music history.

---

### November 26, 2019

#### In Solitude - Sister

Kind of a weird album, not sure if I like it much, straddles different styles without excelling at any of them. It's unique for sure. The title track is the standout on first listen.

#### Ashbury - Endless Skies

A pleasant album. I really like the first song.

#### Agalloch - The Mantle

Life iss a clllaaayyy uuurrrnnn onnn theee Mannnttllleeee...

#### Panopticon - Scars II (The Basics)

These songs stand really well in their stripped-down form. Would love to see this live. Or any Panopticon tbh.

---

### November 25, 2019

#### Sisters of Mercy - Vision Thing

Very different sound than the first album, less gothy, more rocky? I think I like it. Some cool instrumentation and catchy stuff here. The female vocals are a really nice addition. 'More' is the best song no doubt.

#### Sol Invictus - In the Rain

Some dark, wild music. It's deceptively simple...everything sounds sparse, but then it's really layered, with Wakeford's vocals floating above but also driving it all. I feel drenched.

#### Dressed to Kill - Midnight Impulsion

Solid debut y'all keep it up. Best cover art of 2019.

#### Smoulder - Times of Obscene Evil and Wild Daring

Woah, they made a song about Jirel of Joiry. Very solid heavy metal with a sick vocalist.

#### Ulver - Bergtatt

Probably low-key the most influential of anything from 90s Norway on the metal scene. Sooo much came from here.

#### Obsequiae - The Palms of Sorrowed Kings

I bought this on vinyl yesterday without listening to it first and I'm glad I did! It owns, love all the melodies and production. Really unique stuff.

---

### November 22, 2019

#### Birch Book - Werewolf's Eyes

A fellow lover the of cynocephalus, I see. It's nice.

#### Blood Incantation - Hidden History of the Human Race

Dope! What happens when you take a band that runs through everything death metal has ever tried over the course of half an hour, and does it all competently, and more surprisingly coherently!?

#### Vandalorum - Flagellum Dei

Local dungeon synth act is very good. I have seen him live twice now and recognized some of the songs here. Has lots of memorable little bits that are only played once for a few seconds, I like.

#### Manilla Road - Crystal Logic

'Feeling Free Again' is actually not a bad song tbh. Just out of place...

---

### November 21, 2019

#### Rome - Flowers From Exile

Cool neofolk that isn't fascist or fascist-adjacent! Really good stuff, dude has a great voice and music is interesting, gonna listen to him a lot more.

#### Carolina Chocolate Drops - Genuine Negro Jig

'Hit 'Em up Style' and 'Cornbread and Butterbeans' are like two of my favorite songs ever. Would love to see this live one day.

#### Rome - A Passage to Rhodesia

A neat way to explore an important part of history. Music's good, too. 'One Fire' is an easy favorite.

#### Vaura - Sables

With this release Vaura left behind pretty much all of their metallic tinge, and that's ok - in place there's more keyboards, more spacey stuff. It's different, but it works for them, and is the most poppy and catchy of their albums. 'Eidolon' is definitely my favorite track and shows off the best guitar work. I love how prominent the bass is on this album too.

#### The Mission - Children

Never listened to a whole album by The Mission before, they're good. 'Beyond The Pale' and 'Tower of Strength' in particular are monumental songs, really great. 'Dream On' cover is good lol I like it more than the original but I don't like Aerosmith much.

---

### November 20, 2019

#### Sisters of Mercy - First and Last and Always

It's raining here in San Diego today which means it's a good day to listen to 80s goth rock. And this album is one of the best. 'Marianne' and the title track are my favorites.

#### Siouxsie and the Banshees - The Scream

Never listened to Siouxsie much beyond a few songs. Should rectify that.

#### Obsequiae - Aria of Vernal Tombs

Oh this is really cool! The melodies are great, haven't heard anything that sounds like this.

---

### November 19, 2019

#### Wovenhand - Woven Hand

This first Wovenhand album is probably still my favorite. The band went into a really cool direction but something about the personal, dark folky sound here is magical.

#### Haunt - Burst into Flame

Solid heavy metal. I think these guys will find their voice as they keep making music, will definitely listen to their other albums.

#### Riot City - Burn the Night

This sets out to do exactly what it wants to, and does it well. Hits the urge for 80s speed/power metal. They are at their best when they are doing something a little more though, like on 'The Hunter,' which is by far the best track.

#### Theatre of Tragedy - Aégis

One of my favorite albums for many years now. The pinnacle of gothic metal, every song is wonderful and different and memorable. I can't pick a favorite. Never could get into any of Theatre of Tragedy's other albums, or much of the genre at all, but this one is special.

#### Secret Stairways - Enchantment of the Ring

Can't get enough of this. 'Fionvar's Chessboard' continues to be my favorite track but they're all good.

#### Immortal - Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism

One day I will listen to Immortal's mid and late period albums but first, this one again. 'A Perfect Vision of the Rising Northland' sounds a lot like epic Bathory, heh.

#### Bathory - Blood Fire Death

Immortal brought me here. The more I listen to Bathory the more I become convinced Quorthon just did everything that needed to be done, the second wave of black metal was superfluous (kidding, but Bathory _did_ do sooo much).

---

### November 18, 2019

#### Katatonia - Brave Murder Day (Peaceville 2006 reissue)

Katatonia has said they set out to make music that combined the doomy melody of Paradise Lost with the epic blackness of Bathory and by golly they did it. This is my favorite of their metal albums. The riffs are really simple but really inspiring. Funnily enough the weakest part of the album for me is the clean vocals like on 'Day.' I really like Renske's later rock vocal styling but they're just a little too rough here - a minor criticism, 'Day' is still a good song. The three tracks at the end here from the 'Sounds of Decay' EP are definitely the weakest, they just feel kinda dull compared to the BMD tracks.

#### Tiamat - Wildhoney

A very interesting album, not quite like anything else from its time, in how it blends gothic rock and metal.

#### Bathory - The Return of Darkness and Evil

Maybe my favorite Bathory release. The pace, the riffs, the production all comes together perfectly.

#### Venom - Black Metal

Not hard to see why this was so influential. 1982! Wild!

#### Edge of Sanity - Nothing but Death Remains

Solid, if unremarkable, 90s death metal. Not much hinting at the cool band EoS would later become. Some good melodies and riffing, e.g. on 'Decepted by the Cross.'

---

### November 15, 2019

#### Crypt Sermon - The Ruins of Fading Light

Epic melodic doom metal? Cool stuff, 'Christ is Dead' is the best track. Kind of like a more doomy Atlantean Kodex. The singer is great. Lyrics on the last track kinda suck lol.

#### Darkthrone - The Underground Resistance

Does anybody love metal more than these guys? Trick question, who gives a shit, it's another great Darkthrone album that explores their 80s heavy & speed metal influences and does a great job at it. 'Valkyrie' is the best track.

#### Manilla Road - Mystification

This might infact be the best album by the Road. It's got so many high points and amazing songwriting. 'Mystification' gives 'Necropolis' a run for 'best Manilla Road song.' In some ways it's a taming of their sound - less weird, better production, tighter songs - but not at the sacrifice of their identity.

---

### November 14, 2019

#### A Storm of Light - Anthroscene

Well these guys seem to have really found their sound. It's cool, very much rock n' roll with a metallic tinge. The drumming is really good. This record is very upfront about its pessimism about humanity!

#### 16 Horsepower - Sackcloth 'N' Ashes

Real neat, unique music. 'Black Soul Choir' is the immediate memorable song.

#### Agent Steel - Skeptics Apocalypse

Fenriz was right, this shit rips. Listened to it twice.

#### Manilla Road - The Deluge

Another good Manilla Road album. Need to listen more, which is true of all of their albums.

---

### November 13, 2019

#### Sunn O))) - Pyroclasts

Haven't listened to Sunn in a while. This album is apparently practice/warmup recordings? It's pretty cool and sounds a lot like the Sunn of old, though with less crushing doominess. Would be a nice one to have on vinyl.

#### Earth - Primitive and Deadly

I listened to this A LOT when it came out. It's my favorite of Earth's offerings; I think their music works really well with vocals and always wished more than just this and Pentastar had some. Coincidentally those happens to be my two fave Earth releases. 'From the Zodiacal Light' is the hilight here. 'Even Hell Has Its Heroes' has some of Dylan Carlson's best guitar playing ever.

#### Steven Wilson - Hand. Cannot. Erase.

Porcupine Tree was my favorite band for years as a teenager and hey I still like 'em a lot. Never listened to Wilson's solo stuff _too_ much but I do like it. This album moreso than the last ones, not a big fan of the jazzy parts he sometimes has.

#### Black Pyramid - Black Pyramid

Woah this is good. Stoner doom that's got the best parts of the genre all in one...some parts that sound very Sleep-like. And the lyrics seem to be all about fantasy and sci fi books hell yeah.

#### Porcupine Tree Octane Twisted (CD1)

I was listening to Porcupine Tree a lot less with The Incident came out. It's a good album, though, and would have been cool to see live. Luckily there's this! I don't think it reaches the heights that earlier PT did but it was a good way to end their run. 'Time Flies' is the star track.

---

### November 12, 2019

#### Secret Stairways - Enchantment of the Ring

Soo coooool. Want to explore more of this guy's music.

#### Neptune Towers - Caravans to Empire Algol

Turns out Fenriz was pretty good at making cool space ambient too.

#### Blut Aus Nord - Hallucinogen

What a cool album. Large amounts of sick guitar leads and melodies. Not too much like anything BAN's done before, it owns, they continue to be one of the most interesting bands in metal. 'Anthosmos' is my favorite track.

#### Nocturnus AD - Paradox

Woah didn't even know about this one. A worthy follow-up to 'The Key' a quarter of a century later? I'll take it. Really nails their classic sound but with a legit modern spin.

#### Blood Incantation - Starspawn

Holy hell what is this! Amazing death metal, instantly my favorite of the big modern DM bands that have popped up (and there's some other great ones there). This seamlessly blends technicality with huge riffs and wild solos and psychedelic sounds...it's a very modern take on the kind of sound Demilich and Gorguts and the like pioneered years ago.

---

### November 11, 2019

#### Sombre Arcane - Sombre Arcane

Saw these guys live this weekend and it was rad! Really cool show with a legit magic wand instrument. This is a very strong release and every track is very different but all great. 'The Saddest Thing' and 'Return From Dragonspear' are my favorites.

#### Ildjarn & Niddhogg - Hardangervidda

Ildjarn is very underrated. Both his metal and ambient music is great, and never got the attention that his contemporaries did. I can see why for the metal at least, but the ambient stuff is really nice! 'The Troll Dome' is such a great track. It's kinda strange how uplifting and nice sounding this album is, compared to the rawness of Ildjarn's metal.

#### Depressive Silence - Depressive Silence II

#### Manilla Road - To Kill a King

Very sad that the Road had to end when they did but this last album is pretty killer at least. 'Ghost Warriors' is my favorite track on initial listen and not just because it's about the Teutoburg Forest. If you know Manilla Road you know what to expect from this album, and that's a-ok.

---

### November 8, 2019

#### The Ruins of Beverast - Rain Upon the Impure

The coolest fuzzy atmospheric black metal out there. Really inventive stuff and it does a lot with a little. Check out the happy (!) melodies on 'Soil of the Incestuous'!

#### Leviathan - The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide

Never was able to really get into any other Leviathan stuff (love Lurker of Chalice tho) but this album is so good. The style really doesn't work well for me with better production. 'Mine Molten Armor' is my favorite track this listen.

#### Burzum - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss

The album that launched a thousand imitators. One of 'em, at least. Tomhet is a great track, goofy flute thing and all.

#### Manilla Road - Mystification

God what a great album. Manilla Road at their very best. The songwriting is some of the best in metal, every instrument (and Shelton's voice) shines. The production is perfect - everything's audible but not overproduced. AND it's about Edgar Allen Poe because hell yeah of course it is. Then there's 'Children Of The Night' with lyrics about Conan and Norse mythology? The title track is the best of them all.

---

### November 7, 2019

#### Old Sorcery - Realms of Magickal Sorrow

Love how the opening track 'Sorcerer's Dream' builds up over its run time. Really nice music.

#### Paysage d'Hiver - Paysage d'Hiver

Have listened to a lot of Darkspace but never much of Paysage. I dunno why, this album is amazing. The addition of strings and keyboards and stuff to the lo-fi sound is really interesting and kinda weird at first but once it sinks in it's great.

#### maudlin of the Well - My Fruit Psychobells...A Seed Combustible

I have listened to this album maybe hundreds of times and still find something new to love about it on each listen. motW is my favorite band of all time and will probably always be. Two decades later there's still nothing else that sounds like this album. 'Blight of River-Systems' is my favorite song ever. There's shades of everything motW and Kayo Dot and Toby Driver would later go on to do here, and somehow it all works beautifully together.

#### Opeth - Blackwater Park

Like many people I credit Opeth with getting me into harsh vocals and death metal. Them and Cryptopsy. This album holds up for sure, it's a bit samey and sometimes the songs run together (in memory, at least) but it's a super solid slab of proggy death. This was imo Opeth at the top of their game and while I like most of what came after it's a litle sad to think they'll never make music like this again.

#### Diocletian - Against the Flames of a Burning God

Is this 'war metal'? It's ok I guess. Pretty chaotic and harsh! Good name for a band but one that I probably won't listen to very often. There are certainly some interesting things going on with the vocals and guitar work.

---

### November 6, 2019

#### Depressive Silence - Depressive Silence II

Apparently this is 'the' classic dungeon synth album and I can see why. It's complex, rich, and textured and strikes a perfect balance between melancholy and uplifiting. Really inspirational stuff. I want to make music like this.

#### Secret Stairways - Enchantment of the Ring

Another classic dungeon synth album, really like this one. _Lots_ of variety in the tracks. The upbeat 'Finvarra's Chessboard' is wild.

#### Nuit Noire - Infantile Espieglery

My favorite weirdo French band. The sound is all over the place, from the relatively conventional rock riff on 'Are You Ready for the Night?' to the weirdass trash sounds on 'Scrapheap' to Tenebras's bizarre vocals on every track. I dunno who the backing vocalist is but she adds a lot. As an afficianado of faeries and the moon myself I love this band so much.

#### Woods of Ypres - Woods 5: Grey Skies & Electric Lights

Undoubtedly the most mature and probably best Woods album. There are two very strong themes: modernity sucks and is alienating, and you should live your damn life. It's a Woods of Ypres album, yeah. The production is better than ever without being overproduced and there's some of the most interesting music Ypres ever wrote here. How I wish we could have seen what this band would have done next.

#### Old Tower - Stellary Wisdom

Solid dungeon synth if not entirely remarkable on first listen. Not sure if I am a big fan of the big metallic-sounding synths.

#### Agalloch - Pale Folklore (Remastered)

Possibly the Agalloch album I have listened to the most, maybe my favorite, despite how amateur it does sound compared to what they did later. Very "Bergtatt is a cool album huh guys" sound. Not sure how the remastered edition changes things. It's uneven - there are lots of weird bits that stick out and detract from the flow of the album - but when it's good, it's gooooood. The opening 'She Painted Fire Across the Skyline' suite is what made me love Agalloch years ago, I think.

---

### November 5, 2019

#### Acid King - Busse Woods

Never listened to Acid King a whole lot but they are great for a certain mood. 'Electric Machine' is my favorite track here. Somehow I did not know they did a Jesus Christ Superstar cover here but holy heck '39 Lashes' sure is there. A very cool cover. Their minimal, somewhat subdued sound compared to e.g. Electric Wizard is neat. Gotta listen to more Acid King.

#### Trouble - Run to the Light

Never listened to Trouble either. Definitely satisfies the early doom metal urge. 'The Beginning' is my favorite track after one listen.

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

My favorite weirdo early black metal. What a strange thing. 'Unholy Pagan Fire' is my favorite track, that riff! So simple yet so effective.

#### Bathory - Blood Fire Death

\m/

---

### November 4, 2019

#### Visigoth - The Revenant King

Good heavy metal, lots of catchy hooks and solid riffs. The higlight is the Manilla Road cover but that's not really fair because 'Necropolis' is one of the best metal songs ever written. It's a very solid cover!

#### Earth - Full Upon Her Burning Lips

Put off listening to this one for a while. It's a continuation and maturation of the Earth sound that's been developing since 'Hex' almost 15 (!) years ago, meaning Earth has been operating in this mode longer than they haven't been. It's good and they do some really cool stuff - check out 'The Colour of Poison' that sounds almost 'Pentastar'-ish! - while maintaining that core guitar/drums sound.

#### Screaming Trees - Uncle Anesthesthia

A real underrated band, this one. Mark Lanegan is a great singer and they've got some really fun rocky tunes here.

#### Manilla Road - Crystal Logic

A rough, homespun album. I'd have it no other way. It's really weird. Mark Shelton was a brilliant, strange man. 'Finally Free' is the only real weak track. I really genuinely love Mark's vocals. Listening to this a la the original release, with 8 tracks, plus 'Flaming Metal System' at the end, which is pretty cool too, though out of place on this album.

---

### November 3, 2019

#### Earth - Pentastar: In the Style of Demons

Got a new record player set up and this is my favorite LP to spin first. Probably my favorite Earth release, or at least the one I've listened to the most. Every track is killer.

#### Sunn O))) & Ulver - Terrestrials

Beautiful gold vinyl, beautiful sound. The third track with Garm's vocals is definitely the standout.

---

### November 1, 2019

#### Woods of Ypres - Woods 4: The Green Album

Not my favorite Woods album. Not bad, but not the one I'd choose to listen to over the others. It does do something so much metal seems to be afraid of - confronting modernity head-on - through the lyrics, and props for that. David Gold wrote songs about whatever the hell he felt like (sleeping alone vs sleeping next to someone! 'Retrosleep in the Morning') and that's pretty awesome. The last song is some dumb misogynistic bullshit tho lol fuck off with that.

#### Velvet Cacoon - Genevieve

I keep sneezing today and am stuffy as hell so basically this is what my head feels like. Velvet Cacoon may have been tremendous drug-addled assholes but this album is a classic in my book. Way ahead of its time. Who else balanced a hypnotic, low-fi sound and tremendous breakout bits like in 'Avalon Polo'?

#### Mad Season - Live at The Moore

Mad Season's 'Above' is my favorite thing to come out of all of the 90s grunge scene and this is pretty much that done live. It's good as hell and equal in quality to the studio recordings. 'Wake Up' and 'I'm Above' remain my favorite songs. They're all great though. The John Lennon cover is interesting and pretty much a jam session. It really feels like these songs were made to be performed live. Maybe that's just because Layne is so good at owning them. RIP.

#### Pallbearer - Sorrow and Extinction

Hell of an album, hell of a band. Nothing that sounds like them out there.

#### The Magnetic Fields - Get Lost

Probably my favorite of TMF work. Really creative and unique sound. 'You and Me and the Moon' and 'All the Umbrellas in London' are two of my favorite songs ever.

---

#### Woods of Ypres - Woods III: Deepest Roots and Darkest Blues

This album has a perfect title for its sound and lyrics. A synthesis of black metal roots in a modern (for the time) world, in a place that shares a lot in common with where black metal grew up. Ypres's music was always extremely personal and a vehicle for David Gold's emotions and expression and this really comes through on a lot of the songs e.g. 'December in Windsor.'

#### Alcest - Spiritual Instinct

Is very good album. 'Sapphire' is my favorite track.

#### In The Woods... - Cease the Day

'Omnio' is like one of my favorite albums but I never listened to anything else by ITW...maybe I should have! This is a good album. They've clearly still got it.

#### Blind Melon - Live at the Palace

Shannon Hoon is up there with Jeff Buckley on my list of "musicians I wish had lived for many more decades and made much more music." Dude was a great singer and from this recording it seems he was a good performer too. Only wish they had done 'Holyman' here but I'll take what I can get.

---

### October 29, 2019

#### Electrelane - The Power Out

A band I like but never listened to much. Is good, they have a cool dynamic with the two vocalists. Among indie rock they have a pretty unique sound. Relaxing but not boring.

#### Jeff Buckley - Live at Columbia Records Radio Hall

I think, if I could go back and time and see any musician or band live, it would be Jeff Buckley.

---

### October 28, 2019

#### Alcest - Spiritual Instinct

I haven't much kept up with Alcest since...2007 or so. Probably should have. This album is really good, a very obvious evolution of their sound that does all kinds of neat stuff while sounding like Alcest and no one else. Will merit many re-listens (and all the prior albums I haven't given a chance).

#### Immortal Bird - Thrive on Neglect

Yeah, this is the good shit. One of the most creative extreme metal albums I've heard in a while. There's a lot of influence from Gorguts. But also like, every other metal there is. Want to hear a band go from whacky atonal riffs to bits that sound like 90s Emperor to screamo? Immortal Bird has it all. Serious shades of Circle Takes the Square, not really in sound but more in feel. Comparisons aside, it's just really cool on its own merits. Rae Amitay is a monster.

#### Yellow Eyes - Rare Field Ceiling

Cooooool stuff. Throw 'em on the 'post-black metal/blackgaze' pile, but this is one of the better of those I've heard. The guitar work is a lot like Vaura. Like most (all?) post-2000s USBM bands there's a lot of Weakling influence going on here. Will definitely be listening to this band more.

#### Woods of Ypres - Against the Seasons: Cold Winter Songs From The Dead Summer Heat

Never listened to the first Woods release before. It's pretty good, very much shades of the more mature later work they would release. 'A Meeting Place and Time' is the best track and one that already showcases the full spectrum of the sound they'd grow into.

#### Woods of Ypres - Pursuit of the Sun & Allure of the Earth

Still a bit rough in all the best ways.

---

### October 24, 2019

#### Marissa Nadler & Stephen Brodsky - Droneflower

Eerie haunting folky stuff. Different from anything else I've heard from Brodsky. Nadler's voice is very good and I will be listening to more of her stuff. Favorite track is 'Estrangement' which slowly, subtely builds itself up through its almost 8 minute length. Also a Morphine cover at the end! Holy shit! Morphine is so underrated.

#### Marriages - Salome

Might as well check out ERR's band too yeah? I like them. The drumming is my favorite part and sounds more like something you'd hear on a bombastic post-whatever band like Pelican or Russian Circles. Actually the whole sound is like if one of those bands pared themselves down and added more traditional rock vocals. It's interesting. 'Less Than' is my favorite track, it rocks the hardest and has cool beepy boopy sounds.

#### Grails - Chalice Hymnal

My favorite Grails album. They do a lot with a little. Great music for lots of moods. 'Tough Guy' my fave song. 'Deep Snow II' sounds a like a maudlin of the Well song.

#### Emma Ruth Rundle - On Dark Horses

So good I had to listen to it again. 'Darkhorse' might actually be my favorite. Idk it's all great.

---

### October 23, 2019

#### The Atlas Moth - Coma Noir

I've tried to listen to this band a few times before and never got into it. Cool though, definitely a unique sound that falls somewhere in the 'experimental sludge' field. I like the vocals a lot. Needs more listening.

#### Malfet - The Way to Avalon

Ok, Arthurian dungeon synth! This genre seems to have all kinds of stuff for me. And Arthurian it really is - magical, medieval music that invokes Merlin strolling through an enchanted forest on a sunny day.

#### Emma Ruth Rundle - On Dark Horses

In the area of "dark folky women singer/songwriter types" ERR is probably my favorite. Her stuff is heavy without sacrificing any of the underlying elements that make it great. She seems to be blowing up lately and that rules. 'Light Song' is my favorite track.

#### Anna von Hausswolff - Dead Magic

Like if Joanna Newsom got really witchy.

---

### October 22, 2019

#### Nite Jewel - Real High

Pretty neat stuff! Subtle, low-key beats. Nice voice. Relaxing with a little bit of an edge. 'I Don't Know' is an immediate favorite.

#### Sombre Arcane - Sombre Arcane

Cool dark ambient or dungeon synth I guess? Spacey, creepy, weird. Interesting vocals on the first track.

#### Kevin Schilder - Heretic OST

When I was but a wee teen I wanted to make ambient music inspired by Heretic and its rad soundtrack. 10+ years later happy to report that it's still rad. Sounds a lot like dungeon synth, with its medieval influences and all. Or rather dungeon synth sounds a lot like this :) Favorite track has got to be 'The Crypts' which has it all, even a rippin' bassline (?) melody.

#### Fogweaver - Fogweaver

Music inspired by Earthsea? Sign me up. Happy birthday Ursula LeGuin, yesterday, that is. Cool stuff - eerie but cheery synth music that really does capture the vibe of Earthsea well.

---

### October 16, 2019

#### The Oath - The Oath

Too bad this band broke up after just the one album. Would have loved to see what they could have done if they kept going. It's a good release and there was so much potential! 'Silver and Dust' my favorite track.

#### Wolfsheim - No Happy View

Really interesting stuff, a lot darker and not as poppy as much of their later stuff (except for 'The Sparrows And The Nightingales' maybe). Take 'Annie' which is creepy as fuck, with minimal instrumentation and the haunting voice floating over. I love Wolfsheim's anthems like 'Once in a Lifetime' and such but this is something special. It's not all sad, their melancholic optimism comes through in 'It's Not Too Late,' for example.

#### Wolfsheim - Popkiller

An adequate title, even though this album shows signs of moving towards a poppier sound. A bit less weird than the last one, a bit more fleshed out and with fuller production. Lots of cool sounds going on all over the place. 'Now I Fall' is a favorite.

#### Wolfsheim - Spectators

Very slick, great production. I miss the dark weirdness of their earlier stuff but with such amazing songs like 'Once In A Lifetime' and 'Heroin, She Said' can one really complain?

---

### October 15, 2019

#### Mortiis - The Unraveling Mind

Good ol' `Mortiis`. This is a pretty good sampling of his sound, wide and diverse as it is. Dark ambient, industrial and dancey parts, all are found here. Nice music to get some work done to.

#### Blackwater Holylight - Veils of Winter

Another day, another listen. Like it a lot.

#### Omen - Battle Cry

Good 80s heavy metal, not my favorite but pretty fun.

#### Graveyard - Peace

Dudes continue rocking out. Now there are two pieces of media titled 'Peace' that I like, this and the Gene Wolfe book.

#### Electric Citizen - Sateen

The more I listen to this band the more I like them and they do stand out in their genre more than I originally gave them credit for. The singer is so gooood. 'Hawk Nightingale' is actually a pretty cool, very 'Planet Caravan' inspired track.

---

### October 14, 2019

#### Blackwater Holylight - Veils of Winter

Yay new album! On first listen it is heavier, less ethereal than the first one. Defintiely still has the same kind of sound. A weakness of the first album is that some of the tracks tended to blend together, this one seems to have a bit more differentiation. I think they should have more guitar solos.

#### Devil's Witches - Suck My Hex

Interesting release, dude's definitely having a lot of fun here. Kind of a mix of all their past sounds covered in 15 minutes, plus some weird new psych stuff. Doesn't catch my ear immediately like some of the others but worth listening to more for sure.

#### Old Man Wizard - Blame It All on Sorcery

Cool local band! I don't listen to nearly enough local music. Folky rock sound that gets heavy at times. Plenty of catchy hooks to be found here.

---

### October 9, 2019

#### Explosions in the Sky - The Wilderness

- Really different from the EitS I used to listen to a lot, it's cool tho

#### Caspian - Dust and Disquiet

- A band I didn't listen to enough in the past, really good dynamics and variation here

#### Explosions in the Sky - All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone

- Don't make me cry at my desk at work ok ok

#### Pelican - Arktika

- Never got the chance to see Pelican live, I bet they would have been good!

---

### October 7, 2019

#### Pinback - Summer in Abaddon (15th Anniversary Edition)

- My favorite Pinback album no doubt. Cool to do a re-release of a classic.

#### Hop Along - Painted Shut

---

### October 4, 2019

#### Pinback - Information Retrieved

Another good Pinback album, yep.

#### Gatecreeper - Deserted

Aw yeah this rips. Couldn't get into their last release but this one's real cool.

#### Brothertiger - Out of Touch

'High Tide' is a _really_ good song and the rest are ok, don't catch my ear really but pleasant enough.

---

### October 3, 2019

#### Rainer Maria - Look Now Look Again

Less messy, more melodic, more mature than their first album, but still not very polished. It fuckin' rules. Some of their best songs - 'Breakfast of Champions,' 'The Reason the Night is Long' - are to be found here. Like if u cry every time u listen to Rainer Maria.

#### Saetia - Collected

Probably my favorite of the classic 90s skramz acts. Well maybe City of Caterpillar is. But Saetia is really really great. 'Some Natures Catch No Plagues' and 'Venus and Bacchus' are undoubtedly my favorite tracks.

#### Neurosis & Jarboe - Neurosis & Jarboe

Is it the best work either of these have put out on their own? No, but it's still a really neat collaboration and I wish they would have done more. Neurosis has never like they do on this album anywhere else, straddling the line between their doomy/sludgy side and the more noisy parts a la Tribes of Neurot. Jarboe is the perfect singer for this stuff.

#### While Heaven Wept - Of Empires Forlorn

Well this is interesting. Doom prog pop rock? Idk it's kinda cool I'll listen to more.

#### Jawbreaker - Dear You

Oh no a ~divisive album~ well I like it. Some of the best Jawbreaker tracks like 'Bad Scene, Everybody's Fault' and 'Accident Prone' are the be found here for godsakes!

---

### October 2, 2019

#### Woods of Ypres - Pursuit of the Sun & Allure of the Earth

Somebody get David Gold some sunglasses! RIP.

#### Modest Mouse - The Lonesome Crowded West

Is this the best Modest Mouse album? Very possibly. Not a single weak track and they're all wildly different.

#### Pinback - Autumn of the Seraphs

Never listened to any Pinback outside of Summer in Abaddon, which I really like. Turns out this album is good too!

#### Hop Along - Bark Your Head Off, Dog

I really love the song 'Not Abel' but never listened to this whole album til now, it's all good too!

---

### October 1, 2019

#### Hour of 13 - The Ritualist

I will listen to this band more. Cool blend of heavy/doom.

#### Jawbreaker - Live 4/30/96

Woulda been super sick to see this show when I was 5 years old!!

#### Warning - Watching From a Distance

Yeeeep.

#### Reverend Bizarre - Crush the Insects

A modern doom classic, didn't finish listening today, will tomorrow.

---

### September 30, 2019

#### Oathbreaker - Rheia

Oathbreaker gets lumped in with the "post-black metal/blackgaze" scene which is probably more fitting than anything else, but they also don't sound much like anything else in that space. Epic and emotional without even a hint of cheese, this album is just badass. Most of the interest comes from the soft/loud clean/harsh dynamics but on tracks like 'Where I Leave' they show just how capable they are of crafting grandiose songs that buildup over almost ten minutes. Vibes of The Ocean, one of my favorite bands, here, very nice.

#### Devil's Witches - Porno Witch

New Devil's Witches single is something to get excited about. His first full-length Velvet Magic is so good. This song's good too, a bit slower and more down, but fitting for the theme.

#### Lunar Shadow - Far From Light

Epic heavy metal about fantasy, sword & sorcery, and ancient Rome!? Sign me up! It's not bad but not great. The production feels a bit thin, musically there's plenty of fun stuff going on, but nothing is quite as bombastic as it could/should be. Some Bal-Sagoth vibes. I'll definitely listen to the newer album and see how it compares.

#### Christian Mistress - To Your Death

Much more hard rock and less heavy metal than their last album. Not sure if I like that, but that's just my preference - it's good for what it is. Still has plenty of cool solos and guitar work and stuff. Vocals remain great. The bonus track is cool, kinda has a d-beat thing going on.

#### Death Penalty - Death Penalty

Oh hey a band named after Witchfinder General, cool. It's good stuff if a bit unmemorable at first listen. Never got into Cathedral so no attachment there. But there's a great blend of faster stuff and slow doomy stuff.

---

### September 27, 2019

#### Opeth - In Cauda Venenum

Hey a new Opeth album! Well, it's certainly ok and feels like the culmination of what their most recent sound has been working towards. Unfortunately I don't care for that sound much and this album is pretty boring on first listen. Maybe I will try the Swedish version. Opeth is a prog rock band now and that's fine and if you like prog rock you'll probably like this.

#### Wovenhand - Star Treatment

There ain't anything else out there that sounds like Wovenhand. David Eugene Edwards is one of the best musicians alive today. He's like weird Calvinist Michael Gira. This album is pretty dense and hard to get into but totally worth listening to several times.

---

### September 26, 2019

#### Witchcraft - Witchcraft

Maybe my favorite modern band that sound like a 70s band. A strong debut for sure.

#### Witchcraft - Firewood

#### Witchcraft - The Alchemist

Today I will probably listen to all Witchcraft albums. They get a bit better produced as they go on but don't lose any of the sound. 'Samaritan Burden' is a (I think) obvious Tool tribute song, a really good one! Has some of my favorite Witchcraft tracks like 'Remembered' with the saxaphone and all.

#### Witchcraft - Legend

They got a much "fuller" sound here. Production is no longer vintage, very modern rocky. It's different! By far the most poppy stuff they've put out at this point. Some real earworms here...'Ghosts House' for example.

#### Witchcraft

Hey, Witchcraft gets really doomy! Gone completely is the vintage sound. They're a straight up doomy rock band now. It's very good. Monumental tracks like 'Maelstrom' and 'Nucleus' are rounded out by some of their best rockers like 'The Outcast.'

---

### September 25, 2019

#### Hammers of Misfortune - Dead Revolution

Listening to this after their first album yesterday is interesting! There's a lot in common - galloping guitars, sorta "epic" narrative style - but also a lot different. This one is very prog, very prog rocky at times on some tracks. It's good, I dunno how much I will listen to it, but it's cool stuff.

#### Christian Mistress - Possession

Aw yeah, this is the shit. Call it a "retro" sound or whatever, it's pure heavy metal with a great singer and really good production. Every instrument gets a chance to shine and it rocks hard.

#### Tanith - In Another Time

A very accurate album title. The dueling/complimentary vocals are good. Merits more listening.

#### Twisted Tower Dire - Crest of the Martyrs

Kind of a goofy record, but then again I guess it is power metal. Always had a soft spot for these guys as fellow Northern Virginia natives. I don't much care for power metal in general but this is a group I'd listen to more than most.

---

### September 24, 2019

#### Electric Citizen - Sateen

As far as 2010s-era-Black-Sabbath-esque-bands-with-a-woman-singing go, this one is pretty solid. Nothing revolutionary but it's fun and catchy. The slower track 'Hawk Nightingale' is probably the weakest, they're best when they're rocking out. There are some more interesting bits like the bongo (?) breakdown on 'Burning in Hell,' which is the best track on the album.

#### Brocas Helm - Black Death

Pretty good but the production is a bit of a drag (and inconsistent). Maybe it was an intentional choice to have the vox sound faded and weak on tracks like 'Fly High' but I don't much like it. The album has a really _weird_ sound, and one wonders if that was on purpose, or just a side effect of the production? On the plus side the bass is usually strong, and there's enough excellent guitar work here to make this one a keeper.

#### Cirith Ungol - King of the Dead

There is something very funny about a band named after Lord of the Rings that used Michael Moorcock book covers for their album art. Cirith Ungol loved both and so do I. Their music is good too. The vocals take a bit to get used to, but it's fitting for the type of stuff they're doing. A legendary band, this is possibly their best album.

#### Hammers of Misfortune - The Bastard

An underrated group if ever there was one, this album's all over the place. So many cool ideas and different styles brought in. Only weakness is the harsh vocals which are just not well done.

#### Graveyard - Graveyard

Cool Swede rock n' roll. The songs kinda blend together but there's some great ones like 'Satan's Finest' and 'Blue Soul.'

#### Warning - Watching From a Distance

I wiiisshhh that yooouu were with me toooooniiigghhttt...

---

### September 23, 2019

#### Black Sabbath - Master of Reality

It would be fair to say that no one ever did it better than this album.

#### Flower Travellin' Band - Satori

Wild stuff, ahead-of-its-time, etc etc etc.

#### Manilla Road - Crystal Logic

One of my fave heavy metal albums. The duo of 'Necropolis'/'Crystal Logic' is something I could listen to over and over.

#### Manilla Road - Mystification

A little more sophisticated, a little faster. Not my fave of theirs but a solid album no doubt.

#### Darkthrone - Under a Funeral Moon

Occupies a weird place. On one hand it's got riffs and beats and solos that wouldn't be out of place on a death metal release, e.g. Soulside Journey. On the other there's plenty to hint at the sound that would come into maturity with Transilvanian Hunger. There's even like, breakdowns? I guess the progression from SJ -> Blaze -> this -> TH is pretty clear but it's very interesting. Honestly it sounds more like early Bathory than anything else. Sometimes. But then there's weird shit like the last track that doesn't sound like anything else.

---

### September 20, 2019

#### Witchfinder General - Death Penalty

So good I listened to it again. The Black Sabbath influence is obvious but they got their own sound. I think this band is highly underrated for how influential they were.

#### Count Raven - Storm Warning

An album from 1990 that sounds like it should have come out 5 years earlier. Don't mean that as a criticism, it really nails the Sabbath-worship sound.

#### Trespasser - Suffer Alone, Suffer Together

Apparently there are two crusty bands called Trespasser? This is the Australian one. It's pretty straightforward sludgy hardcore/crusty metal/whatever, it's heavy and it's nice to listen to.

#### Panopticon - Kentucky

Probably the best and most important USBM act around, at least my favorite. I remember when this came out in 2012 and being like, wtf, banjos, in my black metal!? But this is an American artist embracing America's own folk music, and it works wonderfully. This album's a bit more rough than the later ones, the vastly different musical styles don't quite mesh together as well sometimes, but that's a minor nitpick - it's amazing, emotional music with a fantastic pro-worker message. Austin Lunn is the man. I hope he keeps making music forever.

#### Ulver - Bergtatt

Ulver's original trilogy will always be my favorite thing they've done and some of my favorite music ever. This album feels so far ahead of its time.

#### Ulver - Kveldssanger

Part 2 is just as good as the first. Didn't make it to Nattens Madrigal today. Maybe later.

---

### September 19, 2019

#### Dopelord - Magick Rites

These guys rule, I like that they're not very aggressive but still heavy.

#### Witchfinder General - Death Penalty

I need to listen to this band (and their contemporaries) more. So fuckin good.

---

### September 18, 2019

#### Conan - Blood Eagle

Not sure what to think, it's sort of awkwardly in between being heavy slow doomy stuff and faster rocky stuff? But can't decide which? I _like_ it but on first listen not very memorable.

#### Kayo Dot - Blue Lambency Downward

Idk, one of my least favorite Kayo Dot releases. Don't care much for the jazzy influences and all the woodwinds.

#### Wolves in the Throne Room - Diadem of 12 Stars

What do you get when you take some nature-loving Cascadian metallers who really like Weakling? Some sick as hell music that's what. You can cry about how it doesn't do anything new or is derivative or whatever, who gives a shit, it's really tight, inspired music that succeeds 100% in what it's trying to do. Throw it up there with "Pale Folklore" as some of the best stuff to come out of the PNW. Never listened to their later stuff much, maybe it's good too, but I could spin this one all day.

---

### September 16, 2019

#### Wampyric Rites - Demo II

Good stuff, production is just right for this kinda thing. Synth tracks are meh, guitars are real good.

---

### September 13, 2019

#### Bell Witch - Mirror Reaper

Probably the best thing they have released, at least my favorite. Very moving. I don't know what to even call this music, post-doom metal? But not like "post-metal" that's more like atmospheric sludge like Cult of Luna or whatever. This is like post-traditional-doom-metal. Warning on dramamine. Whatver it's cool as hell and I can't wait to see what they do next.

#### Atlantean Kodex - The Course of Empire

This is actually kinda disappointing on first listen. The production is more complex, lots of layers and backing vocals and stuff, but I don't think the music benefits from it...nothing is quite as memorable, everything feels a bit slower. Their lyrics are definitely dumb as hell too oooh ahh ~ ever westward, the course of empire ~ dumb shit y'all. All this said I'll give it some more listens because I don't think it's _bad_ necessarily.

---

### September 12, 2019

#### Atlantean Kodex - The Golden Bough

The only two bands I know of who acknowledge being directly inspired by Robert Graves are these guys and, oddly enough, Protest the Hero. The Golden Bough, the book, has been sitting on my shelf for a few weeks now, after I picked it up at a used bookstore. Been meaning to read it for a while. Anyway, this album is really great, epic historical metal and it's a nice bonus that it touches on my literary interests. Some of the lyrical content is...troubling, but the history it's referencing is troubling too ("Saracen hordes," huh). Apparently their latest album deals with non-European history so that'll be a nice change.

#### Atlantean Kodex - The White Goddess

And now the one actually named after Graves's book. I eagerly await "The Witch-Cult in Western Europe" to complete the trifecta of "20th century Western folklore books that are all bullshit but I still believe in them." Yes I kow the Golden Bough was published in 1890 ok. Anyway this album owns too. "Sol Invictus" is far and away the best track, a bold decision to open the album with it, but the rest is pretty good too. Some troubling stuff here too, maybe go lighter on the Churchill next time y'all?

#### Bathory - Blood Fire Death

I think this era Bathory may be my favorite Bathory. Got all the epicness of the later stuff and all the heaviness of the earlier. "A Fine Day to Die" is my favorite Bathory track.

---

### September 11, 2019

#### Emperor - Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk

Have I mentioned that I love this album? It might be my favorite of the 90s Norwegian second wave. I know I said Transilvanian Hunger was earlier but this one is too. It's such a neat sound, innovative and symphonic without sounding cheap or weak. "With Strength I Burn" it probably the standout track. Later Emperor albums and Ihsahn's solo stuff never did it for me, but this one is a true classic 10/10.

---

### September 10, 2019

#### Brocas Helm - Defender of the Crown

I find this kind of heavy metal kind of hit or miss and this one's definitely a hit. Wish these guys had kept making more music.

#### Emperor & Thorns - Emperor vs Thorns

No clue what to think of this. I like both of the groups but this feels...unnecessary?

---

### September 9, 2019

#### Dawn Ray'd - A Thorn, A Blight

Their sound suits their politics well. Not my favorite, but I'll listen to their other stuff for sure.

#### Mizmor - Cairn

Been waiting for this one for a while despite never listening to his earlier stuff much. It's neat, definitely music for a certain mood. Very dooooooom.

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

Supposedly Euronymous hated these guys, right? Probably was just jealous of 'em and how much better they were at making interesting, original music. It's like Bathory on cough syrup.

#### Darkspace - Dark I

Coolest stuff ever. Cold as space. Tbh I could do without the samples.

---

### September 6, 2019

#### Witch Vomit - Poisoned Blood

The OSDM revival thing is neat. Not my favorite kind of music and tbh it all kinda runs together for me but these guys are hella solid.

#### Kayo Dot - Blasphemy

What can you expect from a new Kayo Dot record? That it won't really sound like anything they've put out before, or probably anything else. Holds true here. Gonna have to listen to it a few more times to form a solid opinion, but first impression is positive. More interesting songwriting than their last album, an exploration of styles ranging from darkwave to prog rock to vague metal-adjacent...something. Choirs of the Eye will probably always be my favorite of theirs, but forever kudos to Toby Driver for always looking forward.

#### Armagedda - I Am

Not their best work but it's a fun little EP.

#### Alcest - Le Secrete

I've listened to this so many times and to be honest I don't love it but it's a nice thing and I am glad it exists.

---

### September 5, 2019

#### Darkthrone - Transilvanian Hunger

For my money the best of the second wave Norwegian albums that came out around this time. If someone were to ask "what is black metal" this is the album I'd point them to.

#### Mayhem - De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas

Tight riffing and drumming! The guitar tone on this album is so weird. It's like weak but powerful simultaneously. I love this album. Funeral Fog remains the only Mayhem song I ever learned to play all of the riffs for consistently, many years ago...

#### Armagedda - Only True Believers

This is like, rock n' roll black metal. Not 'black n roll' or whatever, just black metal with some really rockin' punky riffage. Mid-late 2000s Darkthrone kinda sounds like this (and parts of it sound like 90s Darkthrone), wouldn't be surprised if Fenriz was a fan. There's also some slower songs that are executed just as well. A well-rounded album.

##### Rotting Christ - Triarchy of the Lost Lovers

Never listened to this band before, but I like this a lot! The gothy sound is great, there's all kinds of stuff going on here. Pinch harmonics, blast beats and stuff, but there's a really solid foundation under it all.

##### Drudkh - Autumn Aurora

Turns out Drudkh is basically nsbm, welp, gotta stop listening to them :/

---

### September 4, 2019

#### Mayhem - Wolf's Lair Abyss

Pretty cool really. Mayhem was always a pretty weird band and this is a good example of that.

#### Panopticon - The Crescendo of Dusk

A nice EP, Panopticon's "leftover" tracks are still great.

---

### September 3, 2019

#### Falls of Rauros - Hail Wind and Hewn Oak

Probably my favorite FoR album. The Agalloch influence is strong, but their sound is very much their own. Just the right amount of "folk" elements balanced with great black metal instrumentation and vocals.

#### Mutiilation - Hail Satanas We Are the Black Legions

I am pretty meh about LLN in general. This one's fun though. Nice punchy riffs.

#### Nuit Noire/His Electro Blue Voice

Pretty good split, a good pairing. NN's weirdass fairy music goes well with HEBV's sound.

#### Bathory - Bathory

RIP Quorthon one of the all-time greats. Pretty sick

#### Bathory - Under the Sign of the Black Mark

#### Bathory - Blood Fire Death

Today is a Bathory day, eh.

#### Immortal - Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism

Never liked Immortal as much as some of their comrades but definitely a good album, gotta listen to more Immortal.

#### Burzum - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss

What to say about this album, about Burzum? It's a classic, Varg is a piece of shit bad idiot, people will argue about whether you can enjoy art made by bad people until the sun burns out.

#### Leviathan - The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide

Hey, another "I love this album, too bad the artist is an asshole." A good example of what one talented person with a four track recorder can do.

#### Tool - Aenima

Imagine a Tool that took the sound of this album and expanded on it. I love Lateralus and 10,000 Days is pretty great, but what could have been! "H." might be my favorite Tool song.

#### Emperor - In The Nightside Eclipse

I think this one and the next are masterpieces and I could do without the rest. I AM THEM!

#### Blut Aus Nord - Deus Salutis Meae

Idk, it's definitely a BAN album. Would have to listen more but if you like their weird black metal/industrial sound this is moreof that. Not a big fan of the vocals.

#### Falls of Rauros - Patterns in Mythology

This album kicks ass. FoR are doing their own thing, they've got their own unique sound. It's black metal, it's uplifting (and not in a blackgaze way), it's complex, layered music.

#### Tool - Fear Inoculum

It's good! Better than expected! A very mature sounding album that merits many re-listens. Definitely sounds like the summation of their career to this point. Here's hoping they will keep making more music...just not 13 years from now.

#### Weakling - Dead As Dreams

Holy shit! What an album! A true classic, lots of stuff inspired by this but nothing quite like it. The RIFFS are so good.

#### Slough Feg - Digital Resistance

It's definitely a Slough Feg album.

#### Slough Feg - Ape Uprising

A heavier, super rockin' Slough Feg album. Some neat doomy influences.

#### Slough Feg - Down Among the Deadmen

A Slough Feg kinda day!

#### Immortal Bird - Thrive on Neglect

Really cool album. Need to listen more.

#### Bolt Thrower - Those Once Loyal

BOLT THROWER!

#### Ved Buens Ende - Written in Waters

Still nothing that sounds quite like it.

#### Mastodon - Emperor of Sand

Idk, the 'heavy' songs are pretty weak and the 'rock' songs are pretty boring.

#### Cobalt - Gin

A really cool album from a really unique band. Think I prefer 'Slow Forever' on the whole but this one's a keeper.

#### Nocturnus - The Key

One of the coolest old death metal albums there is. Space metal!

#### Darkthrone - A Blaze in the Northern Sky

Classic.

#### Cryptopsy - None So Vile

The best album from one of the best death metal bands of the 90s.

##### Windir - 1184

Imagine what could have been if Valfar was not taken so early. A wonderful, unique album that transcends black metal into something all its own.

##### Dead Congregation - Graves of the Archangels

Need to listen more. Would call it "a solid death metal album."

---

### August 16, 2019

#### Bosse-de-Nage - Further Still

One of the better 'blackgaze' groups out there...not the most _interesting_ music but solid execution. Not a huge fan of the vocals, yes of the drumming.

---

### August 15, 2019

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

A classic of early black metal...nothing else quite like it. Imagine what the genre would have been like if these guys were influential in the way that Darkthrone, Burzum, etc. were.

#### Beherit - Engram

A hell of a comeback album. "How to make an old-school album in the modern era without sounding like a cheap tribute band" 101 here.

##### Warning - Watching from a Distance

An immense album, a modern doom classic.
