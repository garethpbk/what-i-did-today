# WHAT DID YOU LISTEN TO TODAY?

## Keeping track of what I've been listening to, maybe some comments

---

### October 31, 2019

#### Mad Season - Live at The Moore

Mad Season's 'Above' is my favorite thing to come out of all of the 90s grunge scene and this is pretty much that done live. It's good as hell and equal in quality to the studio recordings. 'Wake Up' and 'I'm Above' remain my favorite songs. They're all great though. The John Lennon cover is interesting and pretty much a jam session. It really feels like these songs were made to be performed live. Maybe that's just because Layne is so good at owning them. RIP.

#### Pallbearer - Sorrow and Extinction

Hell of an album, hell of a band. Nothing that sounds like them out there.

#### The Magnetic Fields - Get Lost

Probably my favorite of TMF work. Really creative and unique sound. 'You and Me and the Moon' and 'All the Umbrellas in London' are two of my favorite songs ever.

### October 30, 2019

#### Woods of Ypres - Woods III: Deepest Roots and Darkest Blues

This album has a perfect title for its sound and lyrics. A synthesis of black metal roots in a modern (for the time) world, in a place that shares a lot in common with where black metal grew up. Ypres's music was always extremely personal and a vehicle for David Gold's emotions and expression and this really comes through on a lot of the songs e.g. 'December in Windsor.'

#### Alcest - Spiritual Instinct

Is very good album. 'Sapphire' is my favorite track.

#### In The Woods... - Cease the Day

'Omnio' is like one of my favorite albums but I never listened to anything else by ITW...maybe I should have! This is a good album. They've clearly still got it.

#### Blind Melon - Live at the Palace

Shannon Hoon is up there with Jeff Buckley on my list of "musicians I wish had lived for many more decades and made much more music." Dude was a great singer and from this recording it seems he was a good performer too. Only wish they had done 'Holyman' here but I'll take what I can get.

---

### October 29, 2019

#### Electrelane - The Power Out

A band I like but never listened to much. Is good, they have a cool dynamic with the two vocalists. Among indie rock they have a pretty unique sound. Relaxing but not boring.

#### Jeff Buckley - Live at Columbia Records Radio Hall

I think, if I could go back and time and see any musician or band live, it would be Jeff Buckley.

---

### October 28, 2019

#### Alcest - Spiritual Instinct

I haven't much kept up with Alcest since...2007 or so. Probably should have. This album is really good, a very obvious evolution of their sound that does all kinds of neat stuff while sounding like Alcest and no one else. Will merit many re-listens (and all the prior albums I haven't given a chance).

#### Immortal Bird - Thrive on Neglect

Yeah, this is the good shit. One of the most creative extreme metal albums I've heard in a while. There's a lot of influence from Gorguts. But also like, every other metal there is. Want to hear a band go from whacky atonal riffs to bits that sound like 90s Emperor to screamo? Immortal Bird has it all. Serious shades of Circle Takes the Square, not really in sound but more in feel. Comparisons aside, it's just really cool on its own merits. Rae Amitay is a monster.

#### Yellow Eyes - Rare Field Ceiling

Cooooool stuff. Throw 'em on the 'post-black metal/blackgaze' pile, but this is one of the better of those I've heard. The guitar work is a lot like Vaura. Like most (all?) post-2000s USBM bands there's a lot of Weakling influence going on here. Will definitely be listening to this band more.

#### Woods of Ypres - Against the Seasons: Cold Winter Songs From The Dead Summer Heat

Never listened to the first Woods release before. It's pretty good, very much shades of the more mature later work they would release. 'A Meeting Place and Time' is the best track and one that already showcases the full spectrum of the sound they'd grow into.

#### Woods of Ypres - Pursuit of the Sun & Allure of the Earth

Still a bit rough in all the best ways.

---

### October 24, 2019

#### Marissa Nadler & Stephen Brodsky - Droneflower

Eerie haunting folky stuff. Different from anything else I've heard from Brodsky. Nadler's voice is very good and I will be listening to more of her stuff. Favorite track is 'Estrangement' which slowly, subtely builds itself up through its almost 8 minute length. Also a Morphine cover at the end! Holy shit! Morphine is so underrated.

#### Marriages - Salome

Might as well check out ERR's band too yeah? I like them. The drumming is my favorite part and sounds more like something you'd hear on a bombastic post-whatever band like Pelican or Russian Circles. Actually the whole sound is like if one of those bands pared themselves down and added more traditional rock vocals. It's interesting. 'Less Than' is my favorite track, it rocks the hardest and has cool beepy boopy sounds.

#### Grails - Chalice Hymnal

My favorite Grails album. They do a lot with a little. Great music for lots of moods. 'Tough Guy' my fave song. 'Deep Snow II' sounds a like a maudlin of the Well song.

#### Emma Ruth Rundle - On Dark Horses

So good I had to listen to it again. 'Darkhorse' might actually be my favorite. Idk it's all great.

---

### October 23, 2019

#### The Atlas Moth - Coma Noir

I've tried to listen to this band a few times before and never got into it. Cool though, definitely a unique sound that falls somewhere in the 'experimental sludge' field. I like the vocals a lot. Needs more listening.

#### Malfet - The Way to Avalon

Ok, Arthurian dungeon synth! This genre seems to have all kinds of stuff for me. And Arthurian it really is - magical, medieval music that invokes Merlin strolling through an enchanted forest on a sunny day.

#### Emma Ruth Rundle - On Dark Horses

In the area of "dark folky women singer/songwriter types" ERR is probably my favorite. Her stuff is heavy without sacrificing any of the underlying elements that make it great. She seems to be blowing up lately and that rules. 'Light Song' is my favorite track.

#### Anna von Hausswolff - Dead Magic

Like if Joanna Newsom got really witchy.

---

### October 22, 2019

#### Nite Jewel - Real High

Pretty neat stuff! Subtle, low-key beats. Nice voice. Relaxing with a little bit of an edge. 'I Don't Know' is an immediate favorite.

#### Sombre Arcane - Sombre Arcane

Cool dark ambient or dungeon synth I guess? Spacey, creepy, weird. Interesting vocals on the first track.

#### Kevin Schilder - Heretic OST

When I was but a wee teen I wanted to make ambient music inspired by Heretic and its rad soundtrack. 10+ years later happy to report that it's still rad. Sounds a lot like dungeon synth, with its medieval influences and all. Or rather dungeon synth sounds a lot like this :) Favorite track has got to be 'The Crypts' which has it all, even a rippin' bassline (?) melody.

#### Fogweaver - Fogweaver

Music inspired by Earthsea? Sign me up. Happy birthday Ursula LeGuin, yesterday, that is. Cool stuff - eerie but cheery synth music that really does capture the vibe of Earthsea well.

---

### October 16, 2019

#### The Oath - The Oath

Too bad this band broke up after just the one album. Would have loved to see what they could have done if they kept going. It's a good release and there was so much potential! 'Silver and Dust' my favorite track.

#### Wolfsheim - No Happy View

Really interesting stuff, a lot darker and not as poppy as much of their later stuff (except for 'The Sparrows And The Nightingales' maybe). Take 'Annie' which is creepy as fuck, with minimal instrumentation and the haunting voice floating over. I love Wolfsheim's anthems like 'Once in a Lifetime' and such but this is something special. It's not all sad, their melancholic optimism comes through in 'It's Not Too Late,' for example.

#### Wolfsheim - Popkiller

An adequate title, even though this album shows signs of moving towards a poppier sound. A bit less weird than the last one, a bit more fleshed out and with fuller production. Lots of cool sounds going on all over the place. 'Now I Fall' is a favorite.

#### Wolfsheim - Spectators

Very slick, great production. I miss the dark weirdness of their earlier stuff but with such amazing songs like 'Once In A Lifetime' and 'Heroin, She Said' can one really complain?

---

### October 15, 2019

#### Mortiis - The Unraveling Mind

Good ol' `Mortiis`. This is a pretty good sampling of his sound, wide and diverse as it is. Dark ambient, industrial and dancey parts, all are found here. Nice music to get some work done to.

#### Blackwater Holylight - Veils of Winter

Another day, another listen. Like it a lot.

#### Omen - Battle Cry

Good 80s heavy metal, not my favorite but pretty fun.

#### Graveyard - Peace

Dudes continue rocking out. Now there are two pieces of media titled 'Peace' that I like, this and the Gene Wolfe book.

#### Electric Citizen - Sateen

The more I listen to this band the more I like them and they do stand out in their genre more than I originally gave them credit for. The singer is so gooood. 'Hawk Nightingale' is actually a pretty cool, very 'Planet Caravan' inspired track.

---

### October 14, 2019

#### Blackwater Holylight - Veils of Winter

Yay new album! On first listen it is heavier, less ethereal than the first one. Defintiely still has the same kind of sound. A weakness of the first album is that some of the tracks tended to blend together, this one seems to have a bit more differentiation. I think they should have more guitar solos.

#### Devil's Witches - Suck My Hex

Interesting release, dude's definitely having a lot of fun here. Kind of a mix of all their past sounds covered in 15 minutes, plus some weird new psych stuff. Doesn't catch my ear immediately like some of the others but worth listening to more for sure.

#### Old Man Wizard - Blame It All on Sorcery

Cool local band! I don't listen to nearly enough local music. Folky rock sound that gets heavy at times. Plenty of catchy hooks to be found here.

---

### October 9, 2019

#### Explosions in the Sky - The Wilderness

- Really different from the EitS I used to listen to a lot, it's cool tho

#### Caspian - Dust and Disquiet

- A band I didn't listen to enough in the past, really good dynamics and variation here

#### Explosions in the Sky - All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone

- Don't make me cry at my desk at work ok ok

#### Pelican - Arktika

- Never got the chance to see Pelican live, I bet they would have been good!

---

### October 7, 2019

#### Pinback - Summer in Abaddon (15th Anniversary Edition)

- My favorite Pinback album no doubt. Cool to do a re-release of a classic.

#### Hop Along - Painted Shut

---

### October 4, 2019

#### Pinback - Information Retrieved

Another good Pinback album, yep.

#### Gatecreeper - Deserted

Aw yeah this rips. Couldn't get into their last release but this one's real cool.

#### Brothertiger - Out of Touch

'High Tide' is a _really_ good song and the rest are ok, don't catch my ear really but pleasant enough.

---

### October 3, 2019

#### Rainer Maria - Look Now Look Again

Less messy, more melodic, more mature than their first album, but still not very polished. It fuckin' rules. Some of their best songs - 'Breakfast of Champions,' 'The Reason the Night is Long' - are to be found here. Like if u cry every time u listen to Rainer Maria.

#### Saetia - Collected

Probably my favorite of the classic 90s skramz acts. Well maybe City of Caterpillar is. But Saetia is really really great. 'Some Natures Catch No Plagues' and 'Venus and Bacchus' are undoubtedly my favorite tracks.

#### Neurosis & Jarboe - Neurosis & Jarboe

Is it the best work either of these have put out on their own? No, but it's still a really neat collaboration and I wish they would have done more. Neurosis has never like they do on this album anywhere else, straddling the line between their doomy/sludgy side and the more noisy parts a la Tribes of Neurot. Jarboe is the perfect singer for this stuff.

#### While Heaven Wept - Of Empires Forlorn

Well this is interesting. Doom prog pop rock? Idk it's kinda cool I'll listen to more.

#### Jawbreaker - Dear You

Oh no a ~divisive album~ well I like it. Some of the best Jawbreaker tracks like 'Bad Scene, Everybody's Fault' and 'Accident Prone' are the be found here for godsakes!

---

### October 2, 2019

#### Woods of Ypres - Pursuit of the Sun & Allure of the Earth

Somebody get David Gold some sunglasses! RIP.

#### Modest Mouse - The Lonesome Crowded West

Is this the best Modest Mouse album? Very possibly. Not a single weak track and they're all wildly different.

#### Pinback - Autumn of the Seraphs

Never listened to any Pinback outside of Summer in Abaddon, which I really like. Turns out this album is good too!

#### Hop Along - Bark Your Head Off, Dog

I really love the song 'Not Abel' but never listened to this whole album til now, it's all good too!

---

### October 1, 2019

#### Hour of 13 - The Ritualist

I will listen to this band more. Cool blend of heavy/doom.

#### Jawbreaker - Live 4/30/96

Woulda been super sick to see this show when I was 5 years old!!

#### Warning - Watching From a Distance

Yeeeep.

#### Reverend Bizarre - Crush the Insects

A modern doom classic, didn't finish listening today, will tomorrow.

---

### September 30, 2019

#### Oathbreaker - Rheia

Oathbreaker gets lumped in with the "post-black metal/blackgaze" scene which is probably more fitting than anything else, but they also don't sound much like anything else in that space. Epic and emotional without even a hint of cheese, this album is just badass. Most of the interest comes from the soft/loud clean/harsh dynamics but on tracks like 'Where I Leave' they show just how capable they are of crafting grandiose songs that buildup over almost ten minutes. Vibes of The Ocean, one of my favorite bands, here, very nice.

#### Devil's Witches - Porno Witch

New Devil's Witches single is something to get excited about. His first full-length Velvet Magic is so good. This song's good too, a bit slower and more down, but fitting for the theme.

#### Lunar Shadow - Far From Light

Epic heavy metal about fantasy, sword & sorcery, and ancient Rome!? Sign me up! It's not bad but not great. The production feels a bit thin, musically there's plenty of fun stuff going on, but nothing is quite as bombastic as it could/should be. Some Bal-Sagoth vibes. I'll definitely listen to the newer album and see how it compares.

#### Christian Mistress - To Your Death

Much more hard rock and less heavy metal than their last album. Not sure if I like that, but that's just my preference - it's good for what it is. Still has plenty of cool solos and guitar work and stuff. Vocals remain great. The bonus track is cool, kinda has a d-beat thing going on.

#### Death Penalty - Death Penalty

Oh hey a band named after Witchfinder General, cool. It's good stuff if a bit unmemorable at first listen. Never got into Cathedral so no attachment there. But there's a great blend of faster stuff and slow doomy stuff.

---

### September 27, 2019

#### Opeth - In Cauda Venenum

Hey a new Opeth album! Well, it's certainly ok and feels like the culmination of what their most recent sound has been working towards. Unfortunately I don't care for that sound much and this album is pretty boring on first listen. Maybe I will try the Swedish version. Opeth is a prog rock band now and that's fine and if you like prog rock you'll probably like this.

#### Wovenhand - Star Treatment

There ain't anything else out there that sounds like Wovenhand. David Eugene Edwards is one of the best musicians alive today. He's like weird Calvinist Michael Gira. This album is pretty dense and hard to get into but totally worth listening to several times.

---

### September 26, 2019

#### Witchcraft - Witchcraft

Maybe my favorite modern band that sound like a 70s band. A strong debut for sure.

#### Witchcraft - Firewood

#### Witchcraft - The Alchemist

Today I will probably listen to all Witchcraft albums. They get a bit better produced as they go on but don't lose any of the sound. 'Samaritan Burden' is a (I think) obvious Tool tribute song, a really good one! Has some of my favorite Witchcraft tracks like 'Remembered' with the saxaphone and all.

#### Witchcraft - Legend

They got a much "fuller" sound here. Production is no longer vintage, very modern rocky. It's different! By far the most poppy stuff they've put out at this point. Some real earworms here...'Ghosts House' for example.

#### Witchcraft

Hey, Witchcraft gets really doomy! Gone completely is the vintage sound. They're a straight up doomy rock band now. It's very good. Monumental tracks like 'Maelstrom' and 'Nucleus' are rounded out by some of their best rockers like 'The Outcast.'

---

### September 25, 2019

#### Hammers of Misfortune - Dead Revolution

Listening to this after their first album yesterday is interesting! There's a lot in common - galloping guitars, sorta "epic" narrative style - but also a lot different. This one is very prog, very prog rocky at times on some tracks. It's good, I dunno how much I will listen to it, but it's cool stuff.

#### Christian Mistress - Possession

Aw yeah, this is the shit. Call it a "retro" sound or whatever, it's pure heavy metal with a great singer and really good production. Every instrument gets a chance to shine and it rocks hard.

#### Tanith - In Another Time

A very accurate album title. The dueling/complimentary vocals are good. Merits more listening.

#### Twisted Tower Dire - Crest of the Martyrs

Kind of a goofy record, but then again I guess it is power metal. Always had a soft spot for these guys as fellow Northern Virginia natives. I don't much care for power metal in general but this is a group I'd listen to more than most.

---

### September 24, 2019

#### Electric Citizen - Sateen

As far as 2010s-era-Black-Sabbath-esque-bands-with-a-woman-singing go, this one is pretty solid. Nothing revolutionary but it's fun and catchy. The slower track 'Hawk Nightingale' is probably the weakest, they're best when they're rocking out. There are some more interesting bits like the bongo (?) breakdown on 'Burning in Hell,' which is the best track on the album.

#### Brocas Helm - Black Death

Pretty good but the production is a bit of a drag (and inconsistent). Maybe it was an intentional choice to have the vox sound faded and weak on tracks like 'Fly High' but I don't much like it. The album has a really _weird_ sound, and one wonders if that was on purpose, or just a side effect of the production? On the plus side the bass is usually strong, and there's enough excellent guitar work here to make this one a keeper.

#### Cirith Ungol - King of the Dead

There is something very funny about a band named after Lord of the Rings that used Michael Moorcock book covers for their album art. Cirith Ungol loved both and so do I. Their music is good too. The vocals take a bit to get used to, but it's fitting for the type of stuff they're doing. A legendary band, this is possibly their best album.

#### Hammers of Misfortune - The Bastard

An underrated group if ever there was one, this album's all over the place. So many cool ideas and different styles brought in. Only weakness is the harsh vocals which are just not well done.

#### Graveyard - Graveyard

Cool Swede rock n' roll. The songs kinda blend together but there's some great ones like 'Satan's Finest' and 'Blue Soul.'

#### Warning - Watching From a Distance

I wiiisshhh that yooouu were with me toooooniiigghhttt...

---

### September 23, 2019

#### Black Sabbath - Master of Reality

It would be fair to say that no one ever did it better than this album.

#### Flower Travellin' Band - Satori

Wild stuff, ahead-of-its-time, etc etc etc.

#### Manilla Road - Crystal Logic

One of my fave heavy metal albums. The duo of 'Necropolis'/'Crystal Logic' is something I could listen to over and over.

#### Manilla Road - Mystification

A little more sophisticated, a little faster. Not my fave of theirs but a solid album no doubt.

#### Darkthrone - Under a Funeral Moon

Occupies a weird place. On one hand it's got riffs and beats and solos that wouldn't be out of place on a death metal release, e.g. Soulside Journey. On the other there's plenty to hint at the sound that would come into maturity with Transilvanian Hunger. There's even like, breakdowns? I guess the progression from SJ -> Blaze -> this -> TH is pretty clear but it's very interesting. Honestly it sounds more like early Bathory than anything else. Sometimes. But then there's weird shit like the last track that doesn't sound like anything else.

---

### September 20, 2019

#### Witchfinder General - Death Penalty

So good I listened to it again. The Black Sabbath influence is obvious but they got their own sound. I think this band is highly underrated for how influential they were.

#### Count Raven - Storm Warning

An album from 1990 that sounds like it should have come out 5 years earlier. Don't mean that as a criticism, it really nails the Sabbath-worship sound.

#### Trespasser - Suffer Alone, Suffer Together

Apparently there are two crusty bands called Trespasser? This is the Australian one. It's pretty straightforward sludgy hardcore/crusty metal/whatever, it's heavy and it's nice to listen to.

#### Panopticon - Kentucky

Probably the best and most important USBM act around, at least my favorite. I remember when this came out in 2012 and being like, wtf, banjos, in my black metal!? But this is an American artist embracing America's own folk music, and it works wonderfully. This album's a bit more rough than the later ones, the vastly different musical styles don't quite mesh together as well sometimes, but that's a minor nitpick - it's amazing, emotional music with a fantastic pro-worker message. Austin Lunn is the man. I hope he keeps making music forever.

#### Ulver - Bergtatt

Ulver's original trilogy will always be my favorite thing they've done and some of my favorite music ever. This album feels so far ahead of its time.

#### Ulver - Kveldssanger

Part 2 is just as good as the first. Didn't make it to Nattens Madrigal today. Maybe later.

---

### September 19, 2019

#### Dopelord - Magick Rites

These guys rule, I like that they're not very aggressive but still heavy.

#### Witchfinder General - Death Penalty

I need to listen to this band (and their contemporaries) more. So fuckin good.

---

### September 18, 2019

#### Conan - Blood Eagle

Not sure what to think, it's sort of awkwardly in between being heavy slow doomy stuff and faster rocky stuff? But can't decide which? I _like_ it but on first listen not very memorable.

#### Kayo Dot - Blue Lambency Downward

Idk, one of my least favorite Kayo Dot releases. Don't care much for the jazzy influences and all the woodwinds.

#### Wolves in the Throne Room - Diadem of 12 Stars

What do you get when you take some nature-loving Cascadian metallers who really like Weakling? Some sick as hell music that's what. You can cry about how it doesn't do anything new or is derivative or whatever, who gives a shit, it's really tight, inspired music that succeeds 100% in what it's trying to do. Throw it up there with "Pale Folklore" as some of the best stuff to come out of the PNW. Never listened to their later stuff much, maybe it's good too, but I could spin this one all day.

---

### September 16, 2019

#### Wampyric Rites - Demo II

Good stuff, production is just right for this kinda thing. Synth tracks are meh, guitars are real good.

---

### September 13, 2019

#### Bell Witch - Mirror Reaper

Probably the best thing they have released, at least my favorite. Very moving. I don't know what to even call this music, post-doom metal? But not like "post-metal" that's more like atmospheric sludge like Cult of Luna or whatever. This is like post-traditional-doom-metal. Warning on dramamine. Whatver it's cool as hell and I can't wait to see what they do next.

#### Atlantean Kodex - The Course of Empire

This is actually kinda disappointing on first listen. The production is more complex, lots of layers and backing vocals and stuff, but I don't think the music benefits from it...nothing is quite as memorable, everything feels a bit slower. Their lyrics are definitely dumb as hell too oooh ahh ~ ever westward, the course of empire ~ dumb shit y'all. All this said I'll give it some more listens because I don't think it's _bad_ necessarily.

---

### September 12, 2019

#### Atlantean Kodex - The Golden Bough

The only two bands I know of who acknowledge being directly inspired by Robert Graves are these guys and, oddly enough, Protest the Hero. The Golden Bough, the book, has been sitting on my shelf for a few weeks now, after I picked it up at a used bookstore. Been meaning to read it for a while. Anyway, this album is really great, epic historical metal and it's a nice bonus that it touches on my literary interests. Some of the lyrical content is...troubling, but the history it's referencing is troubling too ("Saracen hordes," huh). Apparently their latest album deals with non-European history so that'll be a nice change.

#### Atlantean Kodex - The White Goddess

And now the one actually named after Graves's book. I eagerly await "The Witch-Cult in Western Europe" to complete the trifecta of "20th century Western folklore books that are all bullshit but I still believe in them." Yes I kow the Golden Bough was published in 1890 ok. Anyway this album owns too. "Sol Invictus" is far and away the best track, a bold decision to open the album with it, but the rest is pretty good too. Some troubling stuff here too, maybe go lighter on the Churchill next time y'all?

#### Bathory - Blood Fire Death

I think this era Bathory may be my favorite Bathory. Got all the epicness of the later stuff and all the heaviness of the earlier. "A Fine Day to Die" is my favorite Bathory track.

---

### September 11, 2019

#### Emperor - Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk

Have I mentioned that I love this album? It might be my favorite of the 90s Norwegian second wave. I know I said Transilvanian Hunger was earlier but this one is too. It's such a neat sound, innovative and symphonic without sounding cheap or weak. "With Strength I Burn" it probably the standout track. Later Emperor albums and Ihsahn's solo stuff never did it for me, but this one is a true classic 10/10.

---

### September 10, 2019

#### Brocas Helm - Defender of the Crown

I find this kind of heavy metal kind of hit or miss and this one's definitely a hit. Wish these guys had kept making more music.

#### Emperor & Thorns - Emperor vs Thorns

No clue what to think of this. I like both of the groups but this feels...unnecessary?

---

### September 9, 2019

#### Dawn Ray'd - A Thorn, A Blight

Their sound suits their politics well. Not my favorite, but I'll listen to their other stuff for sure.

#### Mizmor - Cairn

Been waiting for this one for a while despite never listening to his earlier stuff much. It's neat, definitely music for a certain mood. Very dooooooom.

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

Supposedly Euronymous hated these guys, right? Probably was just jealous of 'em and how much better they were at making interesting, original music. It's like Bathory on cough syrup.

#### Darkspace - Dark I

Coolest stuff ever. Cold as space. Tbh I could do without the samples.

---

### September 6, 2019

#### Witch Vomit - Poisoned Blood

The OSDM revival thing is neat. Not my favorite kind of music and tbh it all kinda runs together for me but these guys are hella solid.

#### Kayo Dot - Blasphemy

What can you expect from a new Kayo Dot record? That it won't really sound like anything they've put out before, or probably anything else. Holds true here. Gonna have to listen to it a few more times to form a solid opinion, but first impression is positive. More interesting songwriting than their last album, an exploration of styles ranging from darkwave to prog rock to vague metal-adjacent...something. Choirs of the Eye will probably always be my favorite of theirs, but forever kudos to Toby Driver for always looking forward.

#### Armagedda - I Am

Not their best work but it's a fun little EP.

#### Alcest - Le Secrete

I've listened to this so many times and to be honest I don't love it but it's a nice thing and I am glad it exists.

---

### September 5, 2019

#### Darkthrone - Transilvanian Hunger

For my money the best of the second wave Norwegian albums that came out around this time. If someone were to ask "what is black metal" this is the album I'd point them to.

#### Mayhem - De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas

Tight riffing and drumming! The guitar tone on this album is so weird. It's like weak but powerful simultaneously. I love this album. Funeral Fog remains the only Mayhem song I ever learned to play all of the riffs for consistently, many years ago...

#### Armagedda - Only True Believers

This is like, rock n' roll black metal. Not 'black n roll' or whatever, just black metal with some really rockin' punky riffage. Mid-late 2000s Darkthrone kinda sounds like this (and parts of it sound like 90s Darkthrone), wouldn't be surprised if Fenriz was a fan. There's also some slower songs that are executed just as well. A well-rounded album.

##### Rotting Christ - Triarchy of the Lost Lovers

Never listened to this band before, but I like this a lot! The gothy sound is great, there's all kinds of stuff going on here. Pinch harmonics, blast beats and stuff, but there's a really solid foundation under it all.

##### Drudkh - Autumn Aurora

Turns out Drudkh is basically nsbm, welp, gotta stop listening to them :/

---

### September 4, 2019

#### Mayhem - Wolf's Lair Abyss

Pretty cool really. Mayhem was always a pretty weird band and this is a good example of that.

#### Panopticon - The Crescendo of Dusk

A nice EP, Panopticon's "leftover" tracks are still great.

---

### September 3, 2019

#### Falls of Rauros - Hail Wind and Hewn Oak

Probably my favorite FoR album. The Agalloch influence is strong, but their sound is very much their own. Just the right amount of "folk" elements balanced with great black metal instrumentation and vocals.

#### Mutiilation - Hail Satanas We Are the Black Legions

I am pretty meh about LLN in general. This one's fun though. Nice punchy riffs.

#### Nuit Noire/His Electro Blue Voice

Pretty good split, a good pairing. NN's weirdass fairy music goes well with HEBV's sound.

#### Bathory - Bathory

RIP Quorthon one of the all-time greats. Pretty sick

#### Bathory - Under the Sign of the Black Mark

#### Bathory - Blood Fire Death

Today is a Bathory day, eh.

---

#### Immortal - Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism

Never liked Immortal as much as some of their comrades but definitely a good album, gotta listen to more Immortal.

#### Burzum - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss

What to say about this album, about Burzum? It's a classic, Varg is a piece of shit bad idiot, people will argue about whether you can enjoy art made by bad people until the sun burns out.

#### Leviathan - The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide

Hey, another "I love this album, too bad the artist is an asshole." A good example of what one talented person with a four track recorder can do.

#### Tool - Aenima

Imagine a Tool that took the sound of this album and expanded on it. I love Lateralus and 10,000 Days is pretty great, but what could have been! "H." might be my favorite Tool song.

#### Emperor - In The Nightside Eclipse

I think this one and the next are masterpieces and I could do without the rest. I AM THEM!

#### Blut Aus Nord - Deus Salutis Meae

Idk, it's definitely a BAN album. Would have to listen more but if you like their weird black metal/industrial sound this is moreof that. Not a big fan of the vocals.

#### Falls of Rauros - Patterns in Mythology

This album kicks ass. FoR are doing their own thing, they've got their own unique sound. It's black metal, it's uplifting (and not in a blackgaze way), it's complex, layered music.

#### Tool - Fear Inoculum

It's good! Better than expected! A very mature sounding album that merits many re-listens. Definitely sounds like the summation of their career to this point. Here's hoping they will keep making more music...just not 13 years from now.

#### Weakling - Dead As Dreams

Holy shit! What an album! A true classic, lots of stuff inspired by this but nothing quite like it. The RIFFS are so good.

#### Slough Feg - Digital Resistance

It's definitely a Slough Feg album.

#### Slough Feg - Ape Uprising

A heavier, super rockin' Slough Feg album. Some neat doomy influences.

#### Slough Feg - Down Among the Deadmen

A Slough Feg kinda day!

#### Immortal Bird - Thrive on Neglect

Really cool album. Need to listen more.

#### Bolt Thrower - Those Once Loyal

BOLT THROWER!

#### Ved Buens Ende - Written in Waters

Still nothing that sounds quite like it.

#### Mastodon - Emperor of Sand

Idk, the 'heavy' songs are pretty weak and the 'rock' songs are pretty boring.

#### Cobalt - Gin

A really cool album from a really unique band. Think I prefer 'Slow Forever' on the whole but this one's a keeper.

#### Nocturnus - The Key

One of the coolest old death metal albums there is. Space metal!

#### Darkthrone - A Blaze in the Northern Sky

Classic.

#### Cryptopsy - None So Vile

The best album from one of the best death metal bands of the 90s.

##### Windir - 1184

Imagine what could have been if Valfar was not taken so early. A wonderful, unique album that transcends black metal into something all its own.

##### Dead Congregation - Graves of the Archangels

Need to listen more. Would call it "a solid death metal album."

#### Bosse-de-Nage - Further Still

One of the better 'blackgaze' groups out there...not the most _interesting_ music but solid execution. Not a huge fan of the vocals, yes of the drumming.

#### Beherit - Drawing Down the Moon

A classic of early black metal...nothing else quite like it. Imagine what the genre would have been like if these guys were influential in the way that Darkthrone, Burzum, etc. were.

#### Beherit - Engram

A hell of a comeback album. "How to make an old-school album in the modern era without sounding like a cheap tribute band" 101 here.

##### Warning - Watching from a Distance

An immense album, a modern doom classic.
